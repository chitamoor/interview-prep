# How do you design an effective interview loop for engineering candidates?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think systematically about assessing candidates. They're looking for a loop that evaluates the right skills, reduces bias, provides a good candidate experience, and yields consistent, defensible hiring decisions.

## Key Points to Cover

- Mapping interview stages to competencies (technical, behavioral, values)
- Structured questions and rubrics for consistency
- Candidate experience (timing, communication, feedback)
- Calibration and debrief process
