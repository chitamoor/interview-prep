# How do you design an effective interview loop for engineering candidates?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think systematically about assessing candidates. They're looking for a loop that evaluates the right skills, reduces bias, provides a good candidate experience, and yields consistent, defensible hiring decisions.

## Key Points to Cover

- Mapping interview stages to competencies (technical, behavioral, values)
- Structured questions and rubrics for consistency
- Candidate experience (timing, communication, feedback)
- Calibration and debrief process

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Describe a loop you designed or improved—stages, what each assesses, why
- Mention how you've reduced bias or improved consistency over time

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a B2B SaaS company, our engineering interview loop was inconsistent—different interviewers asked different questions, feedback was subjective, and we'd had a few mis-hires. We were also hearing that candidates had a poor experience—long wait times, unclear expectations. I led an effort to redesign the loop.

**Task:** I needed to create a loop that assessed the right competencies, reduced bias, provided a good candidate experience, and yielded consistent, defensible decisions.

**Action:** I mapped competencies to stages: technical screen (coding, debugging), system design (architecture, trade-offs, communication), behavioral (collaboration, ownership, growth mindset), and values (alignment with our principles). I created question banks with rubrics for each stage—so we weren't winging it. I standardized the loop: 4 stages, 45 min each, with clear handoffs. I improved candidate experience: we sent a prep guide, reduced scheduling friction with a self-serve tool, and committed to feedback within 48 hours. I also ran calibration sessions: we reviewed sample interviews and aligned on scoring. I tracked consistency metrics: score variance across interviewers dropped, and we saw fewer "hire" vs. "no hire" disagreements in debriefs.

**Result:** Our mis-hire rate dropped significantly. Candidate NPS improved from 42 to 68. Hiring managers reported more confidence in decisions. I learned that a good loop requires structure (questions, rubrics), calibration (shared bar), and attention to experience—candidates are evaluating you too.
