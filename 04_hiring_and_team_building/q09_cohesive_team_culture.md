# How do you build a cohesive team culture when bringing together people from different backgrounds?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can unify diverse teams—different companies, disciplines, or cultures—into a high-performing unit. They're looking for evidence that you create shared norms, psychological safety, and a sense of belonging without erasing individual strengths.

## Key Points to Cover

- Establishing shared goals and norms early
- Creating opportunities for connection (team rituals, retrospectives, social time)
- Valuing different perspectives and making space for varied communication styles
- Addressing conflict and misalignment proactively

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result

## Tips

- Reference a specific merger, reorg, or new hire wave where you built cohesion
- Show you don't force homogeneity—cohesion comes from shared purpose, not sameness
