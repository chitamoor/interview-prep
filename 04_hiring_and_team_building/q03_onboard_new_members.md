# How do you onboard new team members?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have a deliberate, repeatable process for ramping people up. They're looking for evidence that you reduce time-to-productivity, set clear expectations, and create psychological safety so new hires can ask questions and contribute quickly.

## Key Points to Cover

- Having a structured onboarding plan (docs, systems access, first tasks)
- Assigning a buddy or mentor for the first weeks
- Setting clear milestones and check-ins (30/60/90 days)
- Creating feedback loops to improve the process over time

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a Series B startup, we were growing from 15 to 40 engineers in a year. New hires were taking 6–8 weeks to ship their first meaningful PR, and several had reported feeling lost. We had no formal onboarding—it was ad hoc, and it showed. I led a team that was absorbing 3 new engineers in 2 months.

**Task:** I needed to create a structured, repeatable onboarding process that reduced time-to-productivity and created psychological safety for new hires.

**Action:** I designed a 30/60/90 plan. Days 1–5: systems access, intro meetings, architecture overview doc, and a "first PR" guide (small, well-scoped task with a buddy). Days 6–30: shadow a few code reviews, complete 2–3 PRs, attend team rituals. By day 30, they should ship something independently. Days 31–60: own a small feature, present in a team meeting. Days 61–90: full ownership, 360 feedback. I assigned each new hire a buddy for the first month and held weekly check-ins. I created an onboarding runbook and architecture doc that we kept updated. I also ran a retro with recent hires to improve the process—they said the first week felt overwhelming, so we spread it out.

**Result:** Time-to-first-PR dropped from 6 weeks to 2 weeks. New hire satisfaction scores improved. Two engineers who'd joined said the structure made them feel supported. I learned that onboarding is an investment—rushing it creates long-term drag. And that feedback from new hires is the best way to improve it.
