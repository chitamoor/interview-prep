# How do you onboard new team members?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have a deliberate, repeatable process for ramping people up. They're looking for evidence that you reduce time-to-productivity, set clear expectations, and create psychological safety so new hires can ask questions and contribute quickly.

## Key Points to Cover

- Having a structured onboarding plan (docs, systems access, first tasks)
- Assigning a buddy or mentor for the first weeks
- Setting clear milestones and check-ins (30/60/90 days)
- Creating feedback loops to improve the process over time
