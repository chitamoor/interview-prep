# How do you evaluate cultural fit (or cultural add) during the hiring process?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think critically about culture—avoiding homogeneity while still assessing values alignment. They're looking for a nuanced approach that values "cultural add" (what someone brings) over "cultural fit" (sameness), and that you reduce bias in the process.

## Key Points to Cover

- Defining what matters for your team (values, behaviors, collaboration style)
- Using structured questions and rubrics to assess consistently
- Seeking "cultural add" over conformity—diverse perspectives strengthen teams
- Involving multiple interviewers and calibrating to reduce bias

## Tips

- Distinguish between "fit" (sameness) and "add" (contribution)—prefer the latter
- Describe specific values or behaviors you assess and how you probe for them
