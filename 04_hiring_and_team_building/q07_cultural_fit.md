# How do you evaluate cultural fit (or cultural add) during the hiring process?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think critically about culture—avoiding homogeneity while still assessing values alignment. They're looking for a nuanced approach that values "cultural add" (what someone brings) over "cultural fit" (sameness), and that you reduce bias in the process.

## Key Points to Cover

- Defining what matters for your team (values, behaviors, collaboration style)
- Using structured questions and rubrics to assess consistently
- Seeking "cultural add" over conformity—diverse perspectives strengthen teams
- Involving multiple interviewers and calibrating to reduce bias

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Distinguish between "fit" (sameness) and "add" (contribution)—prefer the latter
- Describe specific values or behaviors you assess and how you probe for them

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a startup, we'd had a few hires who were technically strong but didn't mesh with the team—one was overly critical in reviews, another avoided collaboration. We'd also rejected candidates who might have been great because they "didn't fit." I wanted to refine how we assessed culture—moving from gut feel to something more structured, and from "fit" (sameness) to "add" (what they'd contribute).

**Task:** I needed to define what we valued, create a way to assess it consistently, and ensure we weren't selecting for homogeneity.

**Action:** I worked with the team to define our values and translate them into behaviors. For "candor with kindness," we looked for: gives direct feedback, does it constructively, asks for feedback themselves. For "ownership," we looked for: drives outcomes, doesn't wait to be told, follows through. I replaced "culture fit" with "values alignment" and "cultural add"—what would this person bring that we don't have? I created structured behavioral questions with rubrics: "Tell me about a time you gave difficult feedback to a peer" to assess candor. I trained interviewers to probe for specific examples, not hypotheticals. I also ensured we had diverse interviewers so we weren't assessing "would I want to hang out with them" but "do they embody our values."

**Result:** Our next hires brought new perspectives—different backgrounds, communication styles—while aligning on values. We avoided the overly critical hire by catching it in the behavioral round. I learned that "cultural add" is a better frame than "fit"—you want people who strengthen the team, not mirror it. And that structure reduces bias while still assessing what matters.
