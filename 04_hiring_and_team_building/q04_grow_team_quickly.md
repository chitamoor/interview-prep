## Example Response

**Situation:** At a hypergrowth startup, we needed to scale our platform team from 6 to 18 in 9 months to support a major product expansion. We had aggressive hiring targets, and the existing team was already stretched. I was responsible for hiring, onboarding, and maintaining team cohesion during the growth.

**Task:** I needed to ramp hiring without sacrificing our bar, onboard at scale without overwhelming the existing team, and preserve our culture and productivity.

**Action:** I worked with recruiting to prioritize the pipeline—we doubled down on referrals (our best source) and added two agencies for senior roles. I created a hiring capacity plan: each engineer could do 2–3 interviews per week without burning out. I also streamlined our loop from 6 to 4 stages to reduce time-to-hire. For onboarding, I built a scalable program: a dedicated onboarding buddy rotation, a shared runbook, and cohort onboarding so new hires could learn together. I protected the existing team by capping their interview load and ensuring new hires had clear first projects. I ran weekly team syncs to surface integration issues early. We hit some bumps—two hires didn't work out, and we over-hired in one area—but we adjusted.

**Result:** We grew from 6 to 18 in 8 months. Team velocity recovered to pre-growth levels within 4 months of the last hire. Retention was strong—we lost only one person during the growth period. I learned that rapid growth requires planning for capacity (interview load, onboarding) and that preserving culture means being intentional about norms when the team is changing fast.
