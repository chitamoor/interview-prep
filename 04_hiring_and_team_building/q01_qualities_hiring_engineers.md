# What qualities do you look for when hiring engineers?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to understand your hiring philosophy and whether it aligns with their values. They're looking for a balance of technical ability, collaboration, growth mindset, and values—and evidence that you can assess these effectively.

## Key Points to Cover

- Technical competence appropriate to the level
- Communication and collaboration skills
- Growth mindset and learning ability
- Values alignment and team fit

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Be specific—"good communicator" is vague; "can explain technical trade-offs to non-engineers" is concrete
- Mention how you assess these qualities in interviews, not just what you look for
