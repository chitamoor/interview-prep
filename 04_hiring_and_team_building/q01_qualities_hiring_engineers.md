# What qualities do you look for when hiring engineers?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to understand your hiring philosophy and whether it aligns with their values. They're looking for a balance of technical ability, collaboration, growth mindset, and values—and evidence that you can assess these effectively.

## Key Points to Cover

- Technical competence appropriate to the level
- Communication and collaboration skills
- Growth mindset and learning ability
- Values alignment and team fit

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Be specific—"good communicator" is vague; "can explain technical trade-offs to non-engineers" is concrete
- Mention how you assess these qualities in interviews, not just what you look for

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a B2B SaaS company, I was hiring for a senior engineer role. We'd had a few bad hires—technically strong but poor collaborators, or great culture fit but couldn't execute. I needed to refine what we looked for and how we assessed it. I'd been hiring for 8 years and had developed a clear philosophy.

**Task:** I needed to define the qualities that mattered for our team and ensure our interview loop actually evaluated them—not just technical skills.

**Action:** I worked with the team to define our bar: technical competence (design, coding, debugging), communication (can explain trade-offs to non-engineers, writes clearly), collaboration (constructive in reviews, asks good questions), growth mindset (admits gaps, learns from feedback), and ownership (drives outcomes, not just tasks). For each, I mapped interview stages: technical screen for competence, system design for communication, behavioral for collaboration and growth, and a "past project" deep-dive for ownership. I created rubrics so we scored consistently. I also trained interviewers on what to listen for—e.g., "tell me about a time you disagreed with a technical decision" to assess backbone and collaboration. I calibrated with the team after each debrief.

**Result:** Our next 5 hires were strong across the board. Our mis-hire rate dropped. I learned that defining qualities isn't enough—you need to map them to specific interview stages and train interviewers to probe for evidence. Vague criteria lead to inconsistent decisions.
