# How do you retain top talent and keep engineers engaged?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you proactively invest in retention—not just react when someone leaves. They're looking for evidence that you understand what motivates engineers (growth, impact, autonomy, recognition) and that you create conditions for them to thrive.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding individual motivations through regular 1:1s and career conversations
- Providing growth opportunities (stretch projects, mentorship, learning)
- Ensuring meaningful work and visibility of impact
- Creating a culture where people feel valued and heard
