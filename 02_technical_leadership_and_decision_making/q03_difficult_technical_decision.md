# Can you describe a time when you had to make a difficult technical decision? How did you approach it?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see your decision-making process when there's no obvious right answer. They're assessing how you gather information, weigh trade-offs, involve stakeholders, and communicate your rationale.

## Key Points to Cover

- Gathering input from the right people
- Framing trade-offs clearly (cost, risk, timeline, maintainability)
- Making a decision and documenting the rationale
- Revisiting the decision when new information emerges
