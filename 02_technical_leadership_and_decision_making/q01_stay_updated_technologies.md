# How do you stay updated with new technologies, and how do you decide which technologies to adopt?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have a systematic approach to learning and that you're not swayed by hype. They're looking for evidence of deliberate evaluation—weighing business value, team readiness, and risk—rather than chasing trends or resisting change.

## Key Points to Cover

- Having a structured learning routine (newsletters, conferences, experimentation)
- Evaluating technologies against business needs and team context
- Running pilots or proof-of-concepts before adoption
- Balancing innovation with stability and maintainability

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Action

## Tips

- Give concrete examples of technologies you evaluated and adopted—or rejected—and why
- Show you distinguish between "interesting" and "right for our context"
