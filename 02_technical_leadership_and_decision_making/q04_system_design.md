# What's your experience with system design? Can you walk us through a system you designed or improved?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to assess your ability to design scalable, maintainable systems. They're looking for structured thinking, consideration of trade-offs, and awareness of non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, security).

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding requirements and constraints
- Breaking down the problem into components
- Considering scalability, reliability, and failure modes
- Iterating based on feedback and real-world usage

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Prepare 1–2 systems you can walk through in detail (components, data flow, key decisions)
- Be ready to discuss what you'd do differently with hindsight
