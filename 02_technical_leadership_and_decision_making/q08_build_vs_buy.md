# How do you evaluate build vs. buy decisions for your team or organization?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you make pragmatic choices about where to invest engineering time. They're looking for a structured evaluation of cost, fit, vendor risk, and strategic importance—not a default to "we'll build it."

## Key Points to Cover

- Defining requirements and success criteria
- Evaluating total cost of ownership (license, integration, maintenance)
- Considering vendor lock-in, support, and roadmap
- Knowing when custom build is justified (differentiation, control)
