# How do you handle technical debt while delivering new features?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can balance short-term delivery with long-term health. They're looking for a pragmatic approach—neither ignoring debt nor letting it block progress—and evidence that you communicate trade-offs to stakeholders.

## Key Points to Cover

- Making technical debt visible (tracking, prioritizing, quantifying risk)
- Allocating capacity for debt reduction alongside feature work
- Tying debt paydown to business outcomes when possible
- Setting boundaries on when debt is acceptable vs. when it must be addressed
