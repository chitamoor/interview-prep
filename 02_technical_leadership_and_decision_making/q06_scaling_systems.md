# What's your experience with scaling systems, and how have you approached it in the past?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand the challenges of growth—whether in traffic, data, or complexity. They're looking for practical experience with bottlenecks, horizontal vs. vertical scaling, and trade-offs between simplicity and scale.

## Key Points to Cover

- Identifying bottlenecks (profiling, monitoring, load testing)
- Scaling strategies (caching, async, sharding, read replicas)
- Balancing over-engineering vs. under-preparation
- Learning from incidents and iterating

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Use metrics (latency, throughput, error rate) to quantify the problem and solution
- Show you consider cost and operational complexity, not just technical elegance
