# How do you ensure that your engineering efforts align with business goals?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think beyond code and understand how engineering work connects to revenue, customer satisfaction, and strategic objectives. They're looking for a systematic approach—not ad-hoc alignment—and evidence that you proactively seek clarity on business context.

## Key Points to Cover

- Regular alignment rituals (e.g., OKRs, roadmap reviews, stakeholder syncs)
- How you translate business objectives into engineering priorities
- How you validate that shipped work actually supports business goals
- Examples of deprioritizing or saying no to work that doesn't align

### Result

- Include an example where you pushed back on a request that didn't align with stated goals

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a mid-size fintech company, I led a platform engineering team of 12. We had a habit of taking on ad-hoc requests from various stakeholders, which led to context-switching and work that didn't move our strategic needle. Our VP of Product wanted clearer visibility into how engineering contributed to the company's annual goals around customer acquisition and retention.

**Task:** I was responsible for establishing a repeatable process that would align our engineering roadmap with business objectives and make that alignment visible to leadership.

**Action:** I introduced quarterly OKR planning where engineering leaders joined product and business stakeholders in a two-day session. We mapped each business objective to specific engineering initiatives and assigned success metrics. I also instituted a weekly "business sync" where I reviewed our sprint output against those OKRs and flagged drift early. When a senior stakeholder requested a custom reporting feature that would have consumed six weeks but wasn't tied to any OKR, I pushed back with data: I showed our current capacity allocation and proposed we either add it to the next quarter's OKRs or deprioritize it. We used a RICE-style framework to evaluate it, and it was deprioritized.

**Result:** Within two quarters, we went from ~40% of work traceable to business goals to over 85%. Our VP cited the OKR reviews in all-hands as a model for other teams. I learned that alignment isn't a one-time exercise—it requires ongoing rituals and the courage to say no when requests don't fit.
