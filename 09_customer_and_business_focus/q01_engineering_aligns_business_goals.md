# How do you ensure that your engineering efforts align with business goals?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think beyond code and understand how engineering work connects to revenue, customer satisfaction, and strategic objectives. They're looking for a systematic approach—not ad-hoc alignment—and evidence that you proactively seek clarity on business context.

## Key Points to Cover

- Regular alignment rituals (e.g., OKRs, roadmap reviews, stakeholder syncs)
- How you translate business objectives into engineering priorities
- How you validate that shipped work actually supports business goals
- Examples of deprioritizing or saying no to work that doesn't align
