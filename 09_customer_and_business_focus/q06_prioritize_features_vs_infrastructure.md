# How do you prioritize features vs. infrastructure investments?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand both short-term delivery and long-term sustainability. They're assessing your ability to balance visible customer value with the invisible work that keeps systems reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

## Key Points to Cover

- A framework or criteria for balancing features and infrastructure
- How you make the case for infrastructure work to stakeholders
- How you decide when infrastructure debt must be addressed
- Examples of both feature-heavy and infrastructure-heavy periods

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result

## Tips

- Avoid the extremes: neither "we always prioritize features" nor "we always do infrastructure first"
- Reference a specific ratio or rule of thumb if you use one (e.g., 70/30, or "one infra sprint per quarter")
