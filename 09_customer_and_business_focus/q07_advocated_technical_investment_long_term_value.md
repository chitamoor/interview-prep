# Describe a time when you advocated for a technical investment that had long-term business value.

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can champion important but non-urgent work—making the business case for technical investments that don't have immediate ROI. They're looking for persuasion skills, persistence, and the ability to translate technical needs into business language.

## Key Points to Cover

- The specific investment and why it mattered for the business long-term
- How you built the case and presented it to decision-makers
- How you addressed skepticism or competing priorities
- The outcome—did you get buy-in? What was the impact?

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Choose an example where you successfully influenced the decision—or where you learned from not getting buy-in
- Emphasize how you framed the investment in business terms (risk reduction, future velocity, cost avoidance)

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a Series B startup, our monolith was becoming a bottleneck. Deployments took 45 minutes, and a single bug could take down the entire platform. I believed we needed to invest in a service decomposition and CI/CD overhaul, but the CEO was focused on growth and saw it as "engineering wanting to rewrite everything." The CFO was skeptical of any project without immediate revenue impact.

**Task:** I had to make the business case for a six-month technical investment that wouldn't show customer-facing results until the end.

**Action:** I built a cost-of-inaction analysis. I quantified: average of 2 production incidents per month, each costing roughly 4 engineer-hours in firefighting and an estimated 3% churn risk during outages. I projected that over 18 months, the status quo would cost more in lost productivity and risk than the investment. I also framed it as "unlocking velocity"—after the migration, we could ship features 2–3x faster. I presented this to the leadership team with a phased plan: Phase 1 (CI/CD and observability) would show results in 8 weeks. I offered to tie my team's OKRs to both the migration milestones and feature delivery, so we'd be accountable for both. I found an ally in the VP of Product, who was frustrated by our slow release cycle.

**Result:** We got approval for Phase 1, delivered it on time, and used the improved deployment metrics to secure buy-in for the full migration. Within a year, we'd reduced deployment time to under 10 minutes and cut production incidents by 60%. I learned that technical investments need to be framed in business language—risk, cost, and future capability—and that early wins build credibility for larger bets.
