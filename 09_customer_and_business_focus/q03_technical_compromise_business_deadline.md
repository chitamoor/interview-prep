# Describe a time when you made a technical compromise to meet a business deadline.

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can make difficult trade-offs under pressure and that you do so thoughtfully—documenting the compromise, planning remediation, and learning from the outcome. They're checking that you're not rigid or perfectionist to the point of blocking delivery.

## Key Points to Cover

- The specific compromise and why it was necessary
- How you communicated the trade-off to stakeholders and the team
- Whether you documented technical debt or created a follow-up plan
- What happened afterward—did you remediate? What did you learn?
