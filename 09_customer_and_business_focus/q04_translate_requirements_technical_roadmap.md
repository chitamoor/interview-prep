# How do you translate business requirements into a technical roadmap?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can bridge the gap between business stakeholders and engineering execution. They're looking for a structured approach to breaking down high-level goals into actionable technical work, and evidence that you balance feasibility, dependencies, and business value when planning.

## Key Points to Cover

- Discovery and clarification: how you gather and validate requirements with stakeholders
- Prioritization framework: how you rank and sequence work (value, risk, dependencies)
- Breaking down epics into technical milestones and deliverables
- Communication: how you socialize the roadmap and keep stakeholders aligned
