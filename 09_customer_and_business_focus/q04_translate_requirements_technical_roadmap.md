# How do you translate business requirements into a technical roadmap?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can bridge the gap between business stakeholders and engineering execution. They're looking for a structured approach to breaking down high-level goals into actionable technical work, and evidence that you balance feasibility, dependencies, and business value when planning.

## Key Points to Cover

- Discovery and clarification: how you gather and validate requirements with stakeholders
- Prioritization framework: how you rank and sequence work (value, risk, dependencies)
- Breaking down epics into technical milestones and deliverables
- Communication: how you socialize the roadmap and keep stakeholders aligned

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Reference specific frameworks: RICE, MoSCoW, value vs. effort matrices, or dependency mapping
- Show how you handle ambiguity—asking clarifying questions before committing to scope
- Include an example where you adjusted the roadmap based on new information or feedback

## Example Response

**Situation:** I joined a logistics startup as the first engineering manager. The product team had a long list of features from customer interviews, but there was no clear prioritization or technical sequencing. The CTO wanted a coherent roadmap that balanced business value, technical dependencies, and team capacity.

**Task:** I was responsible for turning that backlog into a technical roadmap that product and leadership could understand and commit to.

**Action:** I ran a series of discovery sessions with product and key customers to clarify requirements and success criteria. I then applied a RICE-style framework—rating each initiative on reach, impact, confidence, and effort—and mapped dependencies using a simple dependency graph. I identified that three "quick wins" were blocked by a shared authentication overhaul, so I proposed sequencing: Phase 1 (auth + two high-impact features), Phase 2 (remaining features). I presented the roadmap in a one-pager with milestones, risks, and assumptions. Mid-quarter, a major customer requested a custom integration we hadn't planned for. I re-ran the prioritization with the new data, proposed swapping out a lower-impact item, and got alignment from product before updating the roadmap.

**Result:** We delivered Phase 1 on time, and the roadmap became the standard template for quarterly planning. The CTO later said it was the first time engineering had "spoken the same language" as the business. I learned that translation isn't a one-off—it requires ongoing dialogue and willingness to adjust when new information emerges.
