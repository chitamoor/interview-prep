# How do you measure the customer impact of your team's engineering work?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you connect engineering output to real-world outcomes. They're assessing whether you go beyond velocity and deployment metrics to track adoption, satisfaction, and business results—and whether you use that data to drive decisions.

## Key Points to Cover

- Defining "customer impact" in measurable terms (adoption, retention, NPS, revenue, support tickets)
- Data sources and instrumentation: what you track and how
- Feedback loops: how you gather qualitative and quantitative signals
- How you use impact data to prioritize and iterate

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Name specific metrics: DAU/MAU, conversion rates, error rates, time-to-resolution, customer satisfaction scores
- Show how you balanced leading indicators (usage, engagement) with lagging indicators (revenue, churn)
- Mention how you shared impact data with the team to reinforce customer-centric behavior

## Example Response

**Situation:** I led a growth engineering team at a consumer app with about 2M MAU. We shipped features regularly, but we had little visibility into whether our work actually moved the needle for users or the business. Leadership asked how we could prove the value of our investments.

**Task:** I was responsible for defining and implementing a system to measure the customer impact of our engineering work and use that data to drive prioritization.

**Action:** I worked with product and data science to define a set of north-star and supporting metrics. For our core flows, we tracked conversion rates, time-to-complete, and error rates. We instrumented key features with event tracking and built a simple dashboard that showed before/after comparisons for each release. I also established a biweekly "impact review" where we looked at the data together—what shipped, what moved, what didn't. We balanced leading indicators (e.g., feature adoption, session length) with lagging ones (retention, revenue). When a search improvement we'd invested in showed only a 2% lift, we deprioritized further work and shifted to higher-impact areas.

**Result:** Within six months, we had measurable impact data for over 90% of our shipped features. We used it to kill two low-impact initiatives and double down on three that drove a combined 8% improvement in 30-day retention. The team became more customer-centric because they could see the direct link between their work and outcomes.
