# How do you measure the customer impact of your team's engineering work?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you connect engineering output to real-world outcomes. They're assessing whether you go beyond velocity and deployment metrics to track adoption, satisfaction, and business results—and whether you use that data to drive decisions.

## Key Points to Cover

- Defining "customer impact" in measurable terms (adoption, retention, NPS, revenue, support tickets)
- Data sources and instrumentation: what you track and how
- Feedback loops: how you gather qualitative and quantitative signals
- How you use impact data to prioritize and iterate

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Name specific metrics: DAU/MAU, conversion rates, error rates, time-to-resolution, customer satisfaction scores
- Show how you balanced leading indicators (usage, engagement) with lagging indicators (revenue, churn)
- Mention how you shared impact data with the team to reinforce customer-centric behavior
