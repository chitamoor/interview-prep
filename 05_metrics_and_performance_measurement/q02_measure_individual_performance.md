# How do you measure individual performance in your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to understand how you assess and develop individuals fairly. They're looking for a balanced approach that considers output, growth, collaboration, and impact—without creating a toxic, competitive environment or relying solely on subjective impressions.

## Key Points to Cover

- Clear, transparent criteria that align with team and company goals
- A mix of quantitative and qualitative inputs (not just velocity or lines of code)
- How you use performance data for growth, not just evaluation
- Fairness and consistency in how you apply standards
