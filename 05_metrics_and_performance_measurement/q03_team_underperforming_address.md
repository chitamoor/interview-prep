# How do you know if your team is underperforming, and what steps do you take to address it?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can diagnose performance issues early and take constructive action. They're assessing your ability to distinguish between systemic problems (process, resourcing, clarity) and individual issues—and to intervene without blame or panic.

## Key Points to Cover

- Early warning signs you watch for (delivery slippage, quality issues, morale, attrition)
- How you diagnose root causes before jumping to solutions
- A structured approach to improvement (not just "work harder")
- How you involve the team in the solution rather than imposing fixes

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result

## Tips

- Give a concrete example of a team you helped turn around
- Show that you consider external factors (dependencies, scope changes) before blaming the team
- Emphasize psychological safety—people need to feel safe to surface problems early
