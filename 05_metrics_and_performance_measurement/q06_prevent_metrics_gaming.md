# How do you prevent metrics from being gamed or creating perverse incentives?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand Goodhart's Law—when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. They're looking for evidence that you design metrics thoughtfully, use multiple indicators, and create a culture where honest improvement matters more than hitting numbers.

## Key Points to Cover

- Using balanced scorecards and multiple metrics to avoid single-target gaming
- Focusing on outcome metrics over activity metrics where possible
- Encouraging transparency and psychological safety so people report honestly
- Reviewing metrics design and adjusting when gaming emerges
