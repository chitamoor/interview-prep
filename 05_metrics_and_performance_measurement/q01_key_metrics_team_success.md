# What key metrics do you use to measure the success of your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have a data-driven approach to team management. They're looking for metrics that balance output (delivery, velocity) with outcomes (quality, impact) and team health—not just vanity metrics that look good but don't reflect real success.

## Key Points to Cover

- A mix of output metrics (delivery, throughput) and outcome metrics (quality, business impact)
- Team health and sustainability indicators (retention, engagement, burnout signals)
- How you tailor metrics to the team's context and goals
- How you avoid over-relying on a single metric that can be misleading

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Mention specific metrics (e.g., cycle time, defect escape rate, NPS, sprint predictability)
- Explain why you chose certain metrics over others
- Show that you balance quantitative and qualitative signals

## Example Response

**Situation:** I led a platform engineering team of 12 at a mid-size fintech. We owned core APIs and infrastructure that 40+ product teams depended on. Leadership wanted visibility into our impact, but our previous metrics—story points and sprint velocity—didn't reflect reliability or business outcomes.

**Task:** I was responsible for defining and implementing a metrics framework that would give leadership real insight while helping the team improve.

**Action:** I introduced a balanced scorecard: output metrics (deployment frequency, cycle time), outcome metrics (P99 latency, error budget adherence, incident MTTR), and team health (eNPS, voluntary attrition, burnout survey scores). I worked with our data team to pipe DORA metrics from our CI/CD and observability stack into a weekly dashboard. I also ran a quarterly team health pulse and tied it to our planning—when burnout scores spiked, we deprioritized scope. I presented the framework to leadership in business terms: "We reduced MTTR by 40% this quarter, which directly improved customer-facing uptime from 99.5% to 99.9%."

**Result:** Within two quarters, we cut MTTR from 45 minutes to 27 minutes and improved sprint predictability from 68% to 85%. Leadership adopted our dashboard as the model for other engineering orgs. I learned that executives care about impact and risk—translating cycle time into "faster feature delivery" and error rates into "customer trust" made the metrics stick.
