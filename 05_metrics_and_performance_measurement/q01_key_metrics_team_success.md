# What key metrics do you use to measure the success of your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have a data-driven approach to team management. They're looking for metrics that balance output (delivery, velocity) with outcomes (quality, impact) and team health—not just vanity metrics that look good but don't reflect real success.

## Key Points to Cover

- A mix of output metrics (delivery, throughput) and outcome metrics (quality, business impact)
- Team health and sustainability indicators (retention, engagement, burnout signals)
- How you tailor metrics to the team's context and goals
- How you avoid over-relying on a single metric that can be misleading

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation

### Task

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Mention specific metrics (e.g., cycle time, defect escape rate, NPS, sprint predictability)
- Explain why you chose certain metrics over others
- Show that you balance quantitative and qualitative signals
