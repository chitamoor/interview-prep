# How do you use engineering metrics (e.g., DORA metrics) to drive improvement?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you use data to guide decisions—not just collect it. They're looking for evidence that you connect metrics to actionable changes, involve the team in improvement efforts, and avoid using metrics punitively.

## Key Points to Cover

- Choosing metrics that matter (deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, MTTR)
- Sharing metrics transparently with the team and using them for retrospectives
- Running experiments to improve (e.g., reducing deployment friction)
- Tying metrics to outcomes, not just activity

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Name specific metrics (DORA, cycle time, etc.) and how you acted on them
- Emphasize improvement culture—metrics inform, not judge
