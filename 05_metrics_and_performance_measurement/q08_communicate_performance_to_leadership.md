# How do you communicate team performance to senior leadership?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can translate technical and team metrics into clear, actionable narratives for senior leaders. They're assessing your ability to focus on what matters to executives (business impact, risk, trends) while being honest about challenges and trade-offs.

## Key Points to Cover

- Tailoring the message to the audience (executives care about business impact, risk, and trends)
- Using data to tell a story, not just dumping numbers
- Being transparent about challenges and blockers, not just wins
- Balancing brevity with enough context for informed decisions

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Emphasize executive-friendly framing: "We delivered X, which enabled Y business outcome"
- Mention how you prepare for tough questions (e.g., "Why is velocity down?") with honest answers
- Show that you avoid jargon and translate technical metrics into business language
