# How do you communicate team performance to senior leadership?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can translate technical and team metrics into clear, actionable narratives for senior leaders. They're assessing your ability to focus on what matters to executives (business impact, risk, trends) while being honest about challenges and trade-offs.

## Key Points to Cover

- Tailoring the message to the audience (executives care about business impact, risk, and trends)
- Using data to tell a story, not just dumping numbers
- Being transparent about challenges and blockers, not just wins
- Balancing brevity with enough context for informed decisions

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Emphasize executive-friendly framing: "We delivered X, which enabled Y business outcome"
- Mention how you prepare for tough questions (e.g., "Why is velocity down?") with honest answers
- Show that you avoid jargon and translate technical metrics into business language

## Example Response

**Situation:** I reported to a non-technical VP at a mid-size company. Our engineering metrics—cycle time, deployment frequency, MTTR—meant nothing to her. She wanted to know: are we delivering? Are we at risk? What do we need?

**Task:** I needed to translate team performance into an executive-friendly narrative that enabled decisions.

**Action:** I created a one-page monthly summary: "What we delivered" (3–5 key outcomes with business impact), "How we're performing" (2–3 metrics in plain language—e.g., "We ship 3x faster than last quarter" instead of "cycle time 2.1 days"), "Risks and blockers" (honest, with what I need from leadership), and "Ask" (specific requests). I rehearsed for tough questions—"Why is velocity down?" I'd answer: "We invested in tech debt; here's the payoff timeline." I avoided jargon and always tied technical wins to business outcomes: "We reduced MTTR by 40%, which improved customer-facing uptime and reduced support tickets by 15%." I also sent a brief pre-read before our monthly review so she could digest the data.

**Result:** She started using our updates in board prep. I learned that executives care about impact, risk, and trends—not DORA metrics. Translate everything into their language and make the "ask" explicit.
