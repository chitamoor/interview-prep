# How do you distinguish between leading and lagging indicators for team health?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand the difference between predictive signals (leading) and outcome measures (lagging). They're looking for evidence that you use both—leading indicators to intervene early, lagging indicators to validate impact—and that you don't over-rely on lagging metrics that only tell you what already happened.

## Key Points to Cover

- Defining leading indicators (e.g., PR review time, backlog health, morale signals)
- Defining lagging indicators (e.g., delivery rate, incident count, attrition)
- Using leading indicators for early intervention and course correction
- Using lagging indicators to validate that interventions worked

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give concrete examples of leading vs. lagging indicators you use
- Show you act on leading indicators before problems show up in lagging data
