# How do you evaluate the success of a software release?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think beyond "we shipped on time." They're looking for a holistic view that includes stability, adoption, business impact, and learning—and that you use release retrospectives to improve future releases.

## Key Points to Cover

- Technical success (stability, performance, incident rate, rollback frequency)
- User/business impact (adoption, engagement, revenue, support tickets)
- Process learnings (what went well, what to improve)
- How you balance speed with quality and avoid shipping broken software

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Reference specific post-release metrics (e.g., error rates, P95 latency, feature adoption)
- Mention blameless retrospectives and how you capture lessons learned
- Show that you iterate on the evaluation process itself based on feedback
