# How do you approach career development conversations with your direct reports?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you take career development seriously and have a structured, empathetic approach. They're assessing whether you listen first, help people articulate goals, connect growth to opportunities, and follow through with actionable plans—not just annual reviews.

## Key Points to Cover

- Frequency and format: regular 1:1s, dedicated career conversations, check-ins
- Listening and discovery: understanding aspirations, strengths, and concerns
- Goal-setting: helping translate vague goals into concrete milestones
- Follow-through: connecting people to projects, mentors, or learning resources

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Emphasize that career conversations are separate from performance or project discussions
- Show you ask open-ended questions and let the report drive the agenda
- Mention how you connect career goals to real opportunities (projects, stretch assignments, visibility)
