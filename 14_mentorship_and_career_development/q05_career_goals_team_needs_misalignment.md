# How do you handle a situation where a team member's career goals don't align with the team's needs?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see how you navigate tension between individual aspirations and organizational constraints. They're assessing your ability to be honest without discouraging, explore creative solutions, and help people make informed decisions—including when the best path may be to leave.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding both sides: the person's goals and the team's actual needs
- Exploring options: stretch assignments, lateral moves, cross-team projects, role changes
- Honest conversation: being clear about constraints without shutting down the discussion
- Supporting the outcome: whether they stay and adapt, move internally, or leave

## Example Response

**Situation:** David was a strong senior engineer on my team. In a career conversation, he said he wanted to move into product management—he loved the customer problem space and wanted to own roadmap decisions. Our team needed senior ICs; we had no PM track, and moving him would create a gap. I had to figure out how to handle the misalignment.

**Task:** I needed to be honest about constraints while exploring options. I couldn't promise him a PM role, but I could help him make an informed decision and support whatever path he chose.

**Action:** I first made sure I understood his goals. Was it PM specifically, or influence over product direction? He was clear: he wanted to be a PM. I laid out the reality: we don't have a PM path on this team, and the company's PM roles are competitive. I explored options: Could he do a "PM shadow" or take on product-like responsibilities in his current role? We found a 3-month rotation program where engineers could try PM work. I supported his application and helped him prepare. I also said: "If you love PM and we can't offer it here long-term, I'll support you finding that role elsewhere. I'd rather you thrive than stay and be frustrated." He did the rotation, loved it, and eventually moved to a PM role at another company. I wrote him a strong reference and stayed in touch.

**Result:** David left on good terms and credited me with helping him find his path. The team understood that I'd support their growth even when it meant leaving. I backfilled his role and the team adjusted. I learned that prioritizing someone's long-term growth—even when it means losing them—builds trust and reputation. People remember managers who had their back.
