# How do you handle a situation where a team member's career goals don't align with the team's needs?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see how you navigate tension between individual aspirations and organizational constraints. They're assessing your ability to be honest without discouraging, explore creative solutions, and help people make informed decisions—including when the best path may be to leave.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding both sides: the person's goals and the team's actual needs
- Exploring options: stretch assignments, lateral moves, cross-team projects, role changes
- Honest conversation: being clear about constraints without shutting down the discussion
- Supporting the outcome: whether they stay and adapt, move internally, or leave
