# How do you identify and develop future leaders on your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think about succession and leadership pipeline, not just immediate delivery. They're assessing whether you proactively spot potential, create growth opportunities, and invest in developing people—rather than waiting for vacancies to arise.

## Key Points to Cover

- Identification: what signals you look for (ownership, influence, mentoring, judgment)
- Development opportunities: stretch assignments, visibility, feedback, formal programs
- Mentorship and sponsorship: advocating for high-potential people
- Avoiding bias: ensuring you're not only developing people who resemble current leaders

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Distinguish between "high performer" and "high potential leader"—they're not always the same
- Give a concrete example of someone you developed and what you did
- Mention how you create opportunities for visibility (presenting to leadership, leading initiatives)
