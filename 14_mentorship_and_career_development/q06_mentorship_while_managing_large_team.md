# How do you provide mentorship while managing a large team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you've thought about scaling your impact when you have many direct reports. They're assessing whether you use leverage—delegating mentorship, creating peer support, and focusing your 1:1 time—rather than trying to do everything yourself or neglecting development.

## Key Points to Cover

- Leverage: empowering leads or senior ICs to mentor others; peer mentoring programs
- Prioritization: who gets your deepest mentorship and why (e.g., high potential, critical roles)
- Efficient 1:1s: making limited time count with structure and focus
- Systems: career frameworks, growth plans, and documentation that reduce dependency on you

## Tips

- Acknowledge the tension: you can't give everyone the same depth of mentorship
- Show you've built systems (career ladders, peer programs) so mentorship isn't solely dependent on you
- Mention how you ensure no one falls through the cracks—e.g., regular check-ins even with less frequent 1:1s

## Example Response

**Situation:** I went from managing 6 engineers to 22 after a reorg. I couldn't give everyone the same depth of 1:1 time or mentorship. I had high-potential people who needed development, solid performers who needed support, and a few who were struggling. I risked either burning out trying to do it all or neglecting people.

**Task:** I needed to scale mentorship—use leverage, prioritize, and build systems so development wasn't solely dependent on me.

**Action:** I restructured how I spent my time. I delegated mentorship: I empowered two senior engineers to mentor juniors and mid-levels, and I ran a monthly "mentor sync" to align on development priorities. I prioritized who got my deepest mentorship: high-potential future leaders and people in critical roles got weekly 1:1s; others got bi-weekly. I made every 1:1 count—I used a simple structure: wins, challenges, career, and "what do you need from me?" I also built systems: we had a career ladder doc, growth plan templates, and a "development opportunities" tracker so people could self-serve. I ensured no one fell through the cracks: even with bi-weekly 1:1s, I did a monthly "pulse" with everyone—a quick async check-in or 15-minute sync. I tracked who I hadn't connected with in two weeks and made sure to reach out.

**Result:** We promoted four people in 18 months and retained 95% of the team. People said they felt supported even with less 1:1 time. The senior mentors grew their own leadership skills. I learned that at scale, mentorship requires leverage—you can't do it all yourself, so you build systems and empower others.
