# How do you provide mentorship while managing a large team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you've thought about scaling your impact when you have many direct reports. They're assessing whether you use leverage—delegating mentorship, creating peer support, and focusing your 1:1 time—rather than trying to do everything yourself or neglecting development.

## Key Points to Cover

- Leverage: empowering leads or senior ICs to mentor others; peer mentoring programs
- Prioritization: who gets your deepest mentorship and why (e.g., high potential, critical roles)
- Efficient 1:1s: making limited time count with structure and focus
- Systems: career frameworks, growth plans, and documentation that reduce dependency on you

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Acknowledge the tension: you can't give everyone the same depth of mentorship
- Show you've built systems (career ladders, peer programs) so mentorship isn't solely dependent on you
- Mention how you ensure no one falls through the cracks—e.g., regular check-ins even with less frequent 1:1s
