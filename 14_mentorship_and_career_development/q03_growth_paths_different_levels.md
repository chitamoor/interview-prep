# What's your approach to creating growth paths for engineers at different levels?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand career progression isn't one-size-fits-all. They're assessing whether you can articulate different expectations and growth trajectories for junior, mid, senior, and staff engineers—and whether you tailor development plans accordingly.

## Key Points to Cover

- Level expectations: scope, ownership, influence, and leadership at each level
- Dual tracks: technical (IC) vs. management paths, and how you help people choose
- Stretch and support: matching growth opportunities to current level and readiness
- Transparency: making criteria and paths visible so people can self-assess

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Reference leveling frameworks (e.g., ladder documents) if your company has them
- Show you understand that senior+ growth is often about scope and influence, not just technical skill
- Mention how you handle people who want to grow but aren't ready—support without over-promising
