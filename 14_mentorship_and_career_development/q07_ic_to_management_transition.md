# How do you help engineers transition from individual contributor to management roles?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand the IC-to-manager transition is a significant identity and skill shift. They're assessing whether you help people evaluate if management is right for them, provide realistic previews, support the transition with training and feedback, and handle setbacks.

## Key Points to Cover

- Evaluation: helping them understand what management entails and whether it fits their goals
- Preparation: shadowing, acting manager roles, leadership training before the formal transition
- Support during transition: coaching on delegation, feedback, and letting go of IC work
- Handling struggles: what you do when someone finds the transition harder than expected
