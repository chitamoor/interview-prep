# How do you help engineers transition from individual contributor to management roles?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand the IC-to-manager transition is a significant identity and skill shift. They're assessing whether you help people evaluate if management is right for them, provide realistic previews, support the transition with training and feedback, and handle setbacks.

## Key Points to Cover

- Evaluation: helping them understand what management entails and whether it fits their goals
- Preparation: shadowing, acting manager roles, leadership training before the formal transition
- Support during transition: coaching on delegation, feedback, and letting go of IC work
- Handling struggles: what you do when someone finds the transition harder than expected

## Tips

- Emphasize that you help people make an informed choice—management isn't the only "promotion"
- Mention "acting" or "trial" roles as a way to test the waters before committing
- Acknowledge that some people struggle and may need to step back—and that you'd support that too

## Example Response

**Situation:** Jake was a top senior engineer—great technical judgment, respected by the team. He'd expressed interest in management for years and assumed it was the natural "next step." When a manager role opened, he applied. I had concerns: he loved coding, got frustrated in meetings, and had never managed anyone. I didn't want to set him up to fail.

**Task:** I needed to help him make an informed choice, prepare him if he chose management, and support him through the transition—including if it didn't work out.

**Action:** I had a candid conversation: "Management is a different job—less coding, more people. What appeals to you?" He said he wanted to have more impact and develop people. I offered a "trial": a 3-month acting manager role for a small pod of 3, with me coaching him. He'd keep some IC work but the majority would be people management. I gave him a realistic preview: 1:1s, feedback conversations, prioritization, and saying no to interesting technical work. He took the trial. I met with him weekly to coach on delegation, feedback, and letting go of IC work. He struggled at first—he'd jump in to fix code instead of coaching. I gave direct feedback: "Your job is to develop them, not do it for them." After three months, he said he missed coding too much and the people work drained him. We discussed stepping back. I supported his return to a senior IC role and made sure there was no stigma—I framed it as a successful experiment.

**Result:** Jake went back to IC and thrived. He later became a staff engineer and mentored other ICs. He thanked me for the honest preview and the "off ramp." I learned that the IC-to-manager transition is a choice, not a default—and that supporting someone who steps back builds trust.
