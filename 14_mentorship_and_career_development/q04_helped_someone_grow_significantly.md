# Describe a time when you helped someone grow significantly in their career.

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want concrete evidence that you've had meaningful impact on someone's development. They're assessing your ability to identify potential, provide support, create opportunities, and follow through—and whether you can articulate the specific actions that made a difference.

## Key Points to Cover

- The person's starting point and what they wanted to achieve
- Specific actions you took: feedback, stretch assignments, advocacy, coaching
- Obstacles you helped them overcome
- The outcome: promotion, new role, new skills, or increased confidence
