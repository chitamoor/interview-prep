# What's your approach to performance reviews and development plans?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you treat performance reviews as a development tool, not just a compliance exercise. They're looking for a fair, consistent process that gives useful feedback and connects to concrete growth plans.

## Key Points to Cover

- Ongoing feedback throughout the year, not just at review time
- Clear criteria and evidence-based assessment
- Development plans that are specific, actionable, and owned by the individual
- Two-way conversation—reviews should include the person's perspective and goals
- Follow-through: checking in on development plans and adjusting as needed

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Emphasize that development plans should be co-created, not imposed
- Show that you separate performance assessment from development planning—they're related but distinct
- Mention how you avoid surprises—people should know where they stand before the formal review
