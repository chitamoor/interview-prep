# What's your approach to performance reviews and development plans?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you treat performance reviews as a development tool, not just a compliance exercise. They're looking for a fair, consistent process that gives useful feedback and connects to concrete growth plans.

## Key Points to Cover

- Ongoing feedback throughout the year, not just at review time
- Clear criteria and evidence-based assessment
- Development plans that are specific, actionable, and owned by the individual
- Two-way conversation—reviews should include the person's perspective and goals
- Follow-through: checking in on development plans and adjusting as needed

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Emphasize that development plans should be co-created, not imposed
- Show that you separate performance assessment from development planning—they're related but distinct
- Mention how you avoid surprises—people should know where they stand before the formal review

## Example Response

**Situation:** Our company had a formal annual review process, but it often felt like a surprise—people got feedback at review time that they'd never heard before. Development plans were generic ("improve communication") and rarely followed up on. I inherited a team where two people had been disappointed by their reviews and didn't trust the process.

**Task:** I needed to make performance reviews fair, useful, and connected to real development—and ensure no one was surprised.

**Action:** I separated performance assessment from development planning. For assessment, I collected evidence throughout the year—specific examples of impact, feedback from peers, project outcomes. I shared feedback in real time, not at review time. If someone had a gap, I addressed it in our next 1:1. By the formal review, they'd already heard everything. For development plans, I made them co-created. I asked: "What do you want to work on? What would make you feel like you're growing?" We turned that into 2–3 specific, actionable goals with milestones. I checked in quarterly: "How's the development plan going? What's blocking you?" I also made plans level-appropriate—a junior might focus on technical skills; a senior might focus on scope and influence. I documented everything so we had a clear record and could track progress.

**Result:** No one was surprised in their review. One person who'd previously been disappointed said it was the fairest process they'd experienced. Development plan follow-through improved—we actually used them. I learned that reviews work when they're the culmination of ongoing conversation, not a once-a-year event, and when development plans are owned by the individual, not imposed.
