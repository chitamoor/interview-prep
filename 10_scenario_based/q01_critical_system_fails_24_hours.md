# You find out that a critical system your team is responsible for will fail in 24 hours. What do you do?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see your crisis management approach—how you triage, communicate, and execute under pressure. They're assessing your ability to stay calm, prioritize, and coordinate across stakeholders while working toward a resolution.

## Key Points to Cover

- Immediate triage: assess impact, root cause, and options (fix, mitigate, workaround)
- Communication: notify stakeholders, set expectations, provide updates
- Resource allocation: who does what, escalation paths
- Post-incident: documentation, blameless review, prevention

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Walk through your steps in a logical order: assess → communicate → execute → follow-up
- For hypotheticals, you can say "Here's how I would approach it" and then use a past incident as a concrete example
- Emphasize communication and stakeholder management—not just technical firefighting
