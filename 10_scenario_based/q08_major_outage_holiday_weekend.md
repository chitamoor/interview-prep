# Your team's main product has a major outage during a holiday weekend. Walk me through your response.

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see your incident response approach when stakes are high and resources may be limited. They're assessing your ability to triage, communicate, coordinate, and support the team—especially when people may be off or hard to reach.

## Key Points to Cover

- Immediate assessment: severity, impact, who's available
- Communication: status page, stakeholder updates, internal coordination
- Execution: triage, fix or mitigate, escalate if needed
- Team support: avoid burnout, rotate if possible, acknowledge the sacrifice
- Post-incident: review, documentation, prevention

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Walk through chronologically: first 30 min, first hour, first few hours
- Emphasize customer communication and team care—not just technical resolution
- If you have a real example, use it; otherwise, a clear hypothetical walkthrough is fine
