# A key team member gives their two-week notice during a critical project phase. What do you do?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see how you handle disruption and maintain continuity when losing critical talent. They're assessing your ability to stay calm, prioritize knowledge transfer, support the departing employee, and keep the team and project on track without burning out remaining staff.

## Key Points to Cover

- Immediate response: acknowledge the departure professionally, avoid guilt or pressure
- Knowledge transfer: documenting, pairing, and handoff planning within the two-week window
- Project impact: reassessing timeline, scope, or resources; communicating with stakeholders
- Team morale: supporting remaining team members and preventing further attrition
