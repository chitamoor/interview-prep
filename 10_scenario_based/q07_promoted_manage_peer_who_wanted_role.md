## Example Response

**Situation:** I was promoted to engineering manager for a team of six. One of my peers—let's call him James—had also applied for the role. He had more tenure than I did and was well-liked. I knew he was disappointed, and I was worried about resentment affecting our working relationship and the team dynamic.

**Task:** I had to build a productive manager-report relationship with someone who may have felt passed over, without being defensive or avoidant.

**Action:** I scheduled a 1:1 with James in my first week. I opened directly: "I know you applied for this role too, and I want to acknowledge that. I'd like to understand how you're feeling and how we can work well together." He was honest—he was disappointed but respected the decision. I listened without being defensive. I asked what he wanted from his career and what would make this transition easier. He said he wanted more ownership and visibility. I committed to giving him a lead role on our next major initiative and to advocating for him with my manager when stretch opportunities came up. I also made clear that I'd treat him the same as everyone else—no special treatment, no overcompensation. I checked in periodically over the first few months.

**Result:** James became one of my strongest contributors. He led a critical project and was promoted to senior within a year. Our relationship stayed professional and eventually became genuinely collaborative. I learned that addressing the elephant in the room early, with empathy and directness, defuses tension—and that investing in someone's growth even when they wanted your job builds lasting trust.
