# Your team is consistently missing deadlines. What steps do you take to fix this?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see your diagnostic and problem-solving approach when delivery is broken. They're assessing whether you look at root causes (estimation, scope, capacity, process) rather than blaming people, and whether you implement sustainable fixes rather than short-term workarounds.

## Key Points to Cover

- Diagnosis: investigating why deadlines are missed (estimation accuracy, scope creep, capacity, blockers, dependencies)
- Data-driven analysis: using historical data to identify patterns
- Corrective actions: adjusting estimation, scope management, capacity planning, or process
- Communication: resetting expectations with stakeholders and building trust

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Avoid blaming individuals; focus on process, estimation, and systemic factors
- Show a structured approach: diagnose → hypothesize → implement → measure
- Include how you communicated with stakeholders during the fix (transparency, revised timelines)
