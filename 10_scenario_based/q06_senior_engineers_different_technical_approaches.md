# Two of your senior engineers want to take completely different technical approaches to a critical project. How do you handle this?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see how you resolve technical disagreements without damaging relationships or stalling progress. They're assessing your ability to facilitate debate, make a decision, and get buy-in—even from the person whose approach wasn't chosen.

## Key Points to Cover

- Creating a structured debate: criteria, trade-offs, evidence (spikes, prototypes)
- Involving both engineers in the evaluation process
- Making a clear decision with rationale
- Ensuring the "losing" party feels heard and can commit to the chosen approach

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Avoid "I'd just pick one" or "I'd let them fight it out"—show a process
- Emphasize that both perspectives have value and that the goal is the best outcome, not winning an argument
