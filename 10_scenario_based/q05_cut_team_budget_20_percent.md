# You're asked to cut your team's budget by 20%. How do you approach this?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see how you make difficult trade-offs under constraints. They're assessing your ability to analyze options objectively, involve the team appropriately, protect what matters most, and communicate decisions clearly—without demoralizing the team or sacrificing long-term health.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding the "why": clarifying the business context and timeline
- Analyzing options: tools, contractors, travel, training, headcount, scope reduction
- Prioritization: protecting mission-critical work and team morale
- Communication: transparently explaining decisions and involving the team where appropriate

## Example Response

**Situation:** During a company-wide cost reduction initiative, I was asked to cut my team's budget by 20%. The team had 10 engineers, and we had contracts with contractors, tools, and training. I had two weeks to propose a plan to my VP.

**Task:** I had to analyze options, protect what mattered most, and communicate decisions in a way that didn't demoralize the team.

**Action:** I first clarified the "why" with finance—was this a one-time cut or an ongoing constraint? It was ongoing. I then mapped every budget line: headcount, contractors, tools (AWS, Datadog, etc.), training, travel, and discretionary. I ranked by impact on delivery and morale. I ruled out across-the-board cuts—they feel arbitrary. I proposed: (1) reduce contractor spend by not renewing two part-time roles and redistributing work; (2) consolidate tools (we had overlapping monitoring solutions); (3) defer non-essential training for one quarter; (4) reduce travel to one conference per team per year. I avoided headcount cuts—losing people would have hurt delivery and morale most. I presented the plan to my VP, got approval, and then shared it with the team in a candid 1:1 and team meeting. I acknowledged the impact and invited feedback.

**Result:** We hit the 20% target. We had to defer some nice-to-haves, but we protected core capacity and team morale. One contractor role was converted to full-time later when budget improved. I learned that budget cuts require a clear framework—impact vs. savings—and that transparency with the team builds trust even when the news is hard.
