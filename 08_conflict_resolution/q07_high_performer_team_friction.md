# How do you handle a situation where a high performer is also a source of team friction?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you don't tolerate bad behavior because someone is productive. They're assessing whether you can have difficult conversations with high performers, set clear expectations for behavior, and take action (including consequences) when needed—without being afraid to lose a star contributor.

## Key Points to Cover

- Addressing the behavior directly, not ignoring it because of their output
- Being clear that high performance doesn't excuse poor collaboration or respect
- Working with the individual on specific behavioral changes
- Knowing when to escalate or take stronger action if behavior doesn't improve

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- This is a common and tough scenario—interviewers want to see you've dealt with it
- Emphasize that you focus on behavior, not personality, and give specific examples of what needs to change
- Show that you're willing to make the hard call (e.g., PIP, reassignment) if the person doesn't improve—protecting the team matters more than one individual's output
