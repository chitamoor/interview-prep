# What's your approach when an engineer disagrees with a technical decision?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you value technical input and don't shut down dissent. They're assessing whether you create space for debate, consider the engineer's perspective seriously, and make a decision that the team can support—even if not everyone agrees—while explaining your reasoning.

## Key Points to Cover

- Listening to the engineer's perspective and understanding their reasoning
- Evaluating the disagreement on merit (data, trade-offs, risk)—not hierarchy
- Making a decision when needed and explaining the rationale
- Ensuring the engineer feels heard and can commit to the decision
