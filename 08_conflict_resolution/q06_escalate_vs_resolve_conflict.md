# How do you decide when to escalate a conflict vs. resolving it yourself?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have judgment about when to handle conflicts independently and when to involve others. They're assessing whether you escalate appropriately (not too early, not too late), know who to escalate to, and can articulate clear criteria for that decision.

## Key Points to Cover

- Criteria for resolving yourself (within your authority, no policy/legal implications, parties willing to engage)
- Criteria for escalating (beyond your authority, policy/HR/legal, repeated or escalating behavior, need for senior alignment)
- How you escalate (to whom, with what context, what you've tried)
- Avoiding both over-escalation (every small issue) and under-escalation (letting serious issues fester)

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give an example of a conflict you resolved yourself and one you escalated
- Show that you don't escalate to avoid responsibility—you escalate when it's the right call
- Emphasize that you document what you've tried before escalating so the next person has context

## Example Response

**Situation:** I had two reports in conflict. I'd mediated multiple times—they'd improve briefly, then regress. One of them had started making comments that felt like harassment. I'd addressed it in 1:1s, but it continued. I had to decide: keep trying or escalate.

**Task:** I needed to determine when this was beyond my ability to resolve and required HR or senior leadership.

**Action:** I had clear criteria: I escalate when there's a policy/legal implication (harassment, discrimination), when behavior doesn't improve after multiple interventions, or when I need authority I don't have (e.g., reassignment). This situation met two: the harassment-like behavior and the lack of improvement. I documented what I'd tried: dates of 1:1s, specific feedback given, and the recurrence. I escalated to HR and my manager with a clear summary: "I've addressed this three times. The behavior continues. I need support." I didn't dump the problem—I provided context and a recommended path (HR investigation, possible reassignment). I also told both individuals that I was escalating before I did it—no surprises.

**Result:** HR investigated. One person was reassigned to another team. The conflict resolved. I learned that escalating isn't failure—it's appropriate when the situation exceeds your authority or expertise. Documenting what you've tried makes escalation effective.
