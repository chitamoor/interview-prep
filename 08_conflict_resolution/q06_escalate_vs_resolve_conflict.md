# How do you decide when to escalate a conflict vs. resolving it yourself?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have judgment about when to handle conflicts independently and when to involve others. They're assessing whether you escalate appropriately (not too early, not too late), know who to escalate to, and can articulate clear criteria for that decision.

## Key Points to Cover

- Criteria for resolving yourself (within your authority, no policy/legal implications, parties willing to engage)
- Criteria for escalating (beyond your authority, policy/HR/legal, repeated or escalating behavior, need for senior alignment)
- How you escalate (to whom, with what context, what you've tried)
- Avoiding both over-escalation (every small issue) and under-escalation (letting serious issues fester)

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give an example of a conflict you resolved yourself and one you escalated
- Show that you don't escalate to avoid responsibility—you escalate when it's the right call
- Emphasize that you document what you've tried before escalating so the next person has context
