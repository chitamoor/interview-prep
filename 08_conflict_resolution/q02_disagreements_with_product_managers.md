# How do you handle disagreements with product managers or other stakeholders about priorities?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can advocate for engineering perspective while collaborating with product. They're assessing your ability to use data and reasoning (not emotion or territoriality), find compromise when possible, and escalate respectfully when alignment can't be reached—without damaging the relationship.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding the other party's goals and constraints before pushing back
- Using data, trade-offs, and impact analysis to make your case
- Finding win-win solutions (e.g., phased approach, scope reduction)
- Knowing when to escalate and how to do it constructively

## STAR Method Answer Template

## Tips

- Give a concrete example of a priority disagreement and how you resolved it
- Show that you respect product's role—you're not trying to override them, you're partnering
- Emphasize that you focus on shared goals (customer, business) rather than "engineering vs. product"
