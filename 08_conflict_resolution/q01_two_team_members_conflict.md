# Describe a time when two team members had a conflict. How did you resolve it?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can mediate interpersonal conflict constructively. They're assessing your ability to listen to both sides, identify root causes, facilitate resolution (not impose it), and preserve the working relationship—without taking sides or avoiding the issue.

## Key Points to Cover

- Addressing the conflict early rather than hoping it resolves itself
- Listening to both parties separately and together to understand perspectives
- Finding common ground or a path forward that both can accept
- Following up to ensure the resolution holds and relationships improve
