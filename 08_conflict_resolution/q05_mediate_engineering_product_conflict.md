# How do you mediate between engineering and product/business teams when they have conflicting goals?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can bridge the gap between technical and business perspectives. They're assessing your ability to translate between the two worlds, find common ground, and facilitate solutions that serve both—rather than taking sides or letting the conflict fester.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding both sides' goals, constraints, and language
- Translating technical trade-offs into business impact (and vice versa)
- Facilitating structured discussions (e.g., trade-off matrix, impact vs. effort)
- Finding solutions that address core needs of both parties

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give a concrete example of an engineering-product conflict you mediated
- Show that you don't default to "engineering is right"—you seek the best outcome for the business
- Emphasize that you create shared understanding before pushing for a decision

## Example Response

**Situation:** Engineering wanted to invest 6 weeks in refactoring before building a new feature. Product wanted the feature in 4 weeks and saw the refactor as a delay. The relationship was tense—both sides felt the other didn't understand.

**Task:** I needed to mediate and find a solution that served both engineering quality and product delivery.

**Action:** I set up a joint session. I asked each side to state their goal and constraints. Product: "We need this feature for a customer commitment. 4 weeks is the deadline." Engineering: "The current codebase will make this feature brittle and slow to iterate. We need a foundation." I translated: "So we both want to deliver value—product needs speed, engineering needs sustainability." I proposed a trade-off matrix: we could do a minimal refactor (2 weeks) that unblocked the feature, ship the feature, then do the deeper refactor in the next quarter. I made the trade-offs explicit: "Minimal refactor means we'll have some tech debt to pay later. Is that acceptable?" Both sides agreed. I documented the decision and the rationale so we had a shared record.

**Result:** We shipped the feature in 5 weeks with the minimal refactor. The deeper refactor happened as planned. I learned that mediation is about translating between worlds and finding options that address both sides' core needs—not choosing a winner.
