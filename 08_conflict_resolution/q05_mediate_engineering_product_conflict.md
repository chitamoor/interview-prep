# How do you mediate between engineering and product/business teams when they have conflicting goals?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can bridge the gap between technical and business perspectives. They're assessing your ability to translate between the two worlds, find common ground, and facilitate solutions that serve both—rather than taking sides or letting the conflict fester.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding both sides' goals, constraints, and language
- Translating technical trade-offs into business impact (and vice versa)
- Facilitating structured discussions (e.g., trade-off matrix, impact vs. effort)
- Finding solutions that address core needs of both parties

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give a concrete example of an engineering-product conflict you mediated
- Show that you don't default to "engineering is right"—you seek the best outcome for the business
- Emphasize that you create shared understanding before pushing for a decision
