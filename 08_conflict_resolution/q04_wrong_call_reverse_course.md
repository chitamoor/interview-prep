# Describe a time when you realized you made the wrong call and had to reverse course. How did you handle it?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can admit mistakes and change direction when evidence warrants it. They're assessing your humility, willingness to own the error, and ability to communicate the reversal clearly—without losing credibility or blaming others.

## Key Points to Cover

- How you recognized that the decision was wrong (feedback, data, outcomes)
- How you communicated the reversal to stakeholders and the team
- How you owned the mistake and avoided deflecting blame
- What you did to mitigate impact and prevent similar errors
