# Give an example of a time when you had to manage competing priorities.

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see how you make trade-offs when you can't do everything. They're looking for your prioritization framework, ability to communicate with stakeholders, and willingness to say no or negotiate scope—rather than overcommitting and burning out the team.

## Key Points to Cover

- How you assessed and ranked priorities (impact, urgency, dependencies)
- How you communicated trade-offs to stakeholders and got alignment
- How you protected your team from being pulled in too many directions
- What you deprioritized or deferred, and how you managed expectations

- Show that you involved stakeholders in the trade-off conversation
- Emphasize that you made a clear decision rather than trying to do everything poorly
