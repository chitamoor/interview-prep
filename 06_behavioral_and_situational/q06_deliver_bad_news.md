## Example Response

**Situation:** Our company had to cut 15% of headcount. I was responsible for informing my team. Two of my eight reports would be laid off. I had 24 hours to prepare before the company-wide announcement.

**Task:** I needed to deliver the news to those affected with clarity and empathy, and support the remaining team.

**Action:** I scheduled 1:1s with the two affected individuals first—before the all-hands. I prepared: I knew the severance details, outplacement support, and timeline. I delivered the news directly in the first 30 seconds—no small talk, no delay. I said: "I need to share something difficult. Your role is being eliminated as part of the company restructuring. This is not a reflection of your performance." I paused and let them react. I answered their questions honestly. I didn't sugarcoat or deflect. For the rest of the team, I held a meeting immediately after the announcement. I acknowledged the loss, shared what I could, and made space for their feelings. I also committed to being available for the next week.

**Result:** Both affected individuals said they appreciated the directness and the respect of being told first. The remaining team stayed productive. I learned that bad news requires clarity, empathy, and timing—deliver it directly, acknowledge the impact, and don't hide behind process.
