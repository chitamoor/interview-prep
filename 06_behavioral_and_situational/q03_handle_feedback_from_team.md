# How do you handle feedback from your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you're open to input from your reports and that you don't become defensive. They're assessing whether you create channels for feedback, act on it when appropriate, and model the behavior you expect from others—receiving feedback gracefully.

## Key Points to Cover

- Creating safe channels for feedback (1:1s, retrospectives, anonymous surveys)
- How you respond when you receive critical feedback (listening, thanking, reflecting)
- How you act on feedback when it's valid, and how you communicate when you can't
- Modeling vulnerability—admitting when you're wrong or when you're learning

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give a concrete example of feedback you received and how you responded
- Show that you don't take feedback personally—you separate the message from the messenger
- Emphasize that you encourage feedback even when it's uncomfortable

## Example Response

**Situation:** I managed a team of 10 at a fast-growing startup. In our first engagement survey, my team scored me low on "openness to feedback." I was surprised—I thought I was approachable. A direct report later told me that when they raised concerns in 1:1s, I tended to explain or defend rather than listen.

**Task:** I needed to change how I received feedback and rebuild trust.

**Action:** I started by thanking the person who gave me that feedback and asking for specifics. I created multiple channels: anonymous feedback in retrospectives, a "manager feedback" item on every 1:1 agenda, and quarterly skip-levels where my manager asked my reports about me. I practiced a new response: when someone gave me feedback, I would say "Thank you—I need to sit with that" and not respond defensively in the moment. I followed up later with what I'd reflected on and what I'd change. I also modeled vulnerability—I shared my own mistakes in team meetings and asked for input on decisions. I made it explicit that I wanted feedback, especially when it was hard to give.

**Result:** My "openness to feedback" score improved from 3.2 to 4.5 within a year. I learned that receiving feedback well is a skill—it requires creating channels, not defending, and following through. The messenger matters less than the message.
