# Describe a project that failed. What did you learn from it?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can reflect honestly on failure and extract lessons. They're assessing your accountability (do you own your part?), your ability to learn, and whether you've applied those lessons—not whether you've never failed (that would be a red flag).

## Key Points to Cover

- A clear description of the failure and your role in it
- Honest reflection on what went wrong (including your own contributions)
- Specific lessons learned and how you've applied them since
- How you communicated the failure to stakeholders and what you did next

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Choose a real failure—avoid stories where "we learned something" but everything turned out fine
- Take ownership of your part; don't blame others exclusively
- Show that the failure led to concrete changes in how you or your team operate
