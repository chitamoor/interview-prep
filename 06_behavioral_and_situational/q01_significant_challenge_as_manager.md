## Example Response

**Situation:** I led a team of 14 at a fintech during a major regulatory deadline. We had six months to implement PCI-DSS compliance across our payment stack. Two senior engineers left unexpectedly, and we discovered our legacy system had significant gaps. Leadership was anxious; the board was watching.

**Task:** I was responsible for delivering compliance on time while stabilizing the team and filling knowledge gaps.

**Action:** I broke the work into phases: audit first (understand the gaps), then remediation, then certification. I brought in a compliance consultant to validate our approach and avoid rework. I redistributed work—promoted two mid-level engineers to own critical modules and paired them with the remaining senior. I ran weekly risk reviews with leadership, being transparent about trade-offs. When we hit a blocker with a third-party vendor, I escalated to our VP and negotiated a parallel path. I also protected the team from scope creep—we said no to non-compliance features. I held daily standups and bi-weekly retrospectives to catch issues early.

**Result:** We achieved certification two weeks before the deadline. Zero compliance findings in the audit. I learned that breaking complex challenges into phases, being transparent about risk, and protecting the team from distraction are critical. I'd do one thing differently: start the knowledge transfer earlier when I saw attrition signals.
