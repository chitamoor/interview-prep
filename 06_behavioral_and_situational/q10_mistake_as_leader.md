# Tell me about a time you made a mistake as a leader. How did you recover?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can own your mistakes, learn from them, and repair trust when needed. They're assessing your self-awareness, accountability, and resilience—not whether you've never made a mistake (that would suggest lack of experience or honesty).

## Key Points to Cover

- A clear description of the mistake and your role in it
- How you recognized and acknowledged the mistake (to yourself and others)
- What you did to fix or mitigate the impact
- How you repaired relationships and what you changed to avoid repeating it
