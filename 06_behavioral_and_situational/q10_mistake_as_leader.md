# Tell me about a time you made a mistake as a leader. How did you recover?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can own your mistakes, learn from them, and repair trust when needed. They're assessing your self-awareness, accountability, and resilience—not whether you've never made a mistake (that would suggest lack of experience or honesty).

## Key Points to Cover

- A clear description of the mistake and your role in it
- How you recognized and acknowledged the mistake (to yourself and others)
- What you did to fix or mitigate the impact
- How you repaired relationships and what you changed to avoid repeating it

## Tips

- Emphasize accountability: you owned it, you didn't deflect or minimize
- Show that you apologized where appropriate and took concrete steps to prevent recurrence

## Example Response

**Situation:** I had an engineer who was struggling—missed deadlines, disengaged in meetings. I assumed it was performance and put them on a PIP. Two weeks in, they shared they'd been dealing with a serious health issue and hadn't felt safe to disclose. I had escalated without understanding the full picture.

**Task:** I needed to own my mistake, repair trust, and change how I handled similar situations.

**Action:** I apologized directly: "I made a mistake. I should have asked more questions before assuming. I'm sorry." I paused the PIP and had a real conversation about what support they needed. We agreed on a flexible arrangement—reduced hours, async where possible—and I connected them with our EAP. I also reflected on my process: I had skipped the "what's going on?" conversation and gone straight to formal process. I added a step to my manager playbook: before any performance process, I now ask "Is there anything outside work affecting your capacity?" I shared the lesson with my manager so she knew I'd made an error and was addressing it.

**Result:** The engineer stayed, recovered, and eventually became a strong contributor. I learned that assuming the worst and escalating quickly can cause real harm. Listening first, always.
