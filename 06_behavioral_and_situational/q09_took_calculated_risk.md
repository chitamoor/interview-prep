# Describe a time when you took a calculated risk. What was the outcome?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can take thoughtful risks when the situation warrants it—not recklessness, but informed boldness. They're assessing your judgment, ability to weigh trade-offs, and willingness to own the outcome whether it succeeds or fails.

## Key Points to Cover

- What the risk was and why you considered it calculated (not reckless)
- How you assessed the upside, downside, and mitigation options
- Who you consulted or informed before taking the risk
- The outcome and what you learned

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result

## Tips

- "Calculated" means you had a rationale—explain your thinking
- A risk that paid off is fine, but a risk that didn't work out (with lessons learned) can be equally compelling
- Show that you considered the impact on others, not just yourself
