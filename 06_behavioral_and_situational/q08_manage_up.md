# Tell me about a time you had to manage up — influencing your own manager or leadership.

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can influence decisions above you when you don't have formal authority. They're assessing your political savvy, communication skills, and ability to advocate for your team or your perspective—without being pushy or undermining your manager.

## Key Points to Cover

- What you were trying to influence (resource, priority, decision, visibility)
- How you prepared (data, framing, understanding your manager's priorities)
- How you made your case (timing, channel, tone)
- The outcome and what you learned about managing up
