# Tell me about a time you disagreed with a senior leader's decision. How did you handle it?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can respectfully dissent when you believe a decision is wrong, without being insubordinate or burning bridges. They're assessing your ability to advocate for your team and your perspective while maintaining professional relationships and knowing when to accept a final call.

## Key Points to Cover

- How you raised your concerns (privately, with data, with alternatives)
- How you listened to the leader's reasoning and remained open to being wrong
- How you supported the decision once it was made, even if you disagreed
- The outcome—whether the decision was changed, or you learned something from the process

- Emphasize respect and professionalism, not confrontation

## Example Response

**Situation:** Our VP of Engineering decided to consolidate our three platform teams into one to "reduce duplication." I led one of those teams and believed the consolidation would slow us down—we had different domains, different customers, and merging would create a 40-person team with unclear ownership.

**Task:** I needed to raise my concerns without undermining the VP or appearing resistant to change.

**Action:** I requested a private 1:1. I came prepared with data: our team's cycle time, incident ownership, and stakeholder satisfaction. I framed it as "I want to understand the rationale and share what I'm seeing." I listened first—he was concerned about resource efficiency and cross-team coordination. I proposed an alternative: keep the teams but create a shared platform council for alignment, and consolidate only the DevOps function. I wrote a one-pager comparing both approaches. I made clear that if he decided to proceed with consolidation, I would support it and make it work.

**Result:** He chose a hybrid: we kept two teams and merged the third into the larger one. He thanked me for the pushback and the alternative. I learned that disagreeing respectfully—with data, in private, with alternatives—builds trust. Even when the final call goes the other way, the process matters.
