# Tell me about a time you disagreed with a senior leader's decision. How did you handle it?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can respectfully dissent when you believe a decision is wrong, without being insubordinate or burning bridges. They're assessing your ability to advocate for your team and your perspective while maintaining professional relationships and knowing when to accept a final call.

## Key Points to Cover

- How you raised your concerns (privately, with data, with alternatives)
- How you listened to the leader's reasoning and remained open to being wrong
- How you supported the decision once it was made, even if you disagreed
- The outcome—whether the decision was changed, or you learned something from the process
