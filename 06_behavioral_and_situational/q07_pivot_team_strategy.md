# Describe a situation where you had to pivot your team's strategy quickly. What happened?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can lead through change and uncertainty. They're assessing your agility, communication skills, and ability to rally the team around a new direction—especially when people may be invested in the old plan or resistant to change.

## Key Points to Cover

- What triggered the pivot (market, customer, technical, leadership decision)
- How you communicated the change and the rationale to the team
- How you helped the team let go of the old plan and embrace the new one
- How you managed the transition (reprioritization, scope changes, stakeholder updates)
