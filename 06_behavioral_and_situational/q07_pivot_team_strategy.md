# Describe a situation where you had to pivot your team's strategy quickly. What happened?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can lead through change and uncertainty. They're assessing your agility, communication skills, and ability to rally the team around a new direction—especially when people may be invested in the old plan or resistant to change.

## Key Points to Cover

- What triggered the pivot (market, customer, technical, leadership decision)
- How you communicated the change and the rationale to the team
- How you helped the team let go of the old plan and embrace the new one
- How you managed the transition (reprioritization, scope changes, stakeholder updates)

## Example Response

**Situation:** I led a team building a new mobile app for a B2B product. We were six months in when the company acquired a competitor with an existing app. Leadership decided to sunset our project and adopt the acquired product. My team of 12 had invested heavily—they were frustrated and demoralized.

**Task:** I needed to pivot the team quickly, communicate the rationale, and find a new mission that felt meaningful.

**Action:** I learned the full context first—why the acquisition, what the timeline was, what roles we'd have. I held a team meeting within 48 hours. I started by acknowledging the disappointment: "I know we've poured ourselves into this. The decision to pivot isn't a reflection of our work—it's a business decision." I explained the rationale clearly: cost, time-to-market, and strategic fit. I then laid out what was next: we'd integrate our best features into the acquired app, and half the team would move to that product. I gave people 1:1 time to process. I also advocated with leadership for retention bonuses and clear role clarity. I reprioritized our backlog, communicated with stakeholders, and set a 30-day transition plan.

**Result:** We retained 11 of 12 engineers. Within three months, we'd shipped two major features into the acquired product. I learned that pivots require acknowledging loss first, then providing clarity. People can move on when they understand why and what's next.
