# How do you tailor your communication style depending on the audience?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you're not a one-size-fits-all communicator—you adjust depth, tone, and focus based on who you're talking to. They're assessing your emotional intelligence and ability to meet people where they are.

## Key Points to Cover

- How you adapt for executives vs. peers vs. direct reports
- Adjusting technical depth and jargon
- Matching format to audience (slides vs. docs vs. verbal)
- Reading the room and adjusting in real time

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give a concrete contrast: "With executives I lead with outcomes; with engineers I go into architecture"
- Avoid sounding like you're "dumbing down" for some audiences—frame it as meeting their needs

## Example Response

**Situation:** I managed a platform team that worked with executives, product managers, other engineering teams, and my direct reports. The same project—a major infrastructure upgrade—required me to communicate with all of them, but each audience needed different information and depth.

**Task:** I had to tailor my communication so each group got what they needed to make decisions or do their jobs, without overwhelming or under-informing anyone.

**Action:** For executives, I led with outcomes and risk: "This upgrade will reduce our infrastructure cost by 20% and improve reliability. The main risk is a 2-week migration window; we'll do it during a low-traffic period." One slide, three bullets. For product, I focused on impact to their roadmap: "We'll need to pause feature work for two sprints during the migration. Here's the timeline and what we'll deliver before and after." For other engineering teams, I went deeper: architecture diagrams, API changes, and migration steps. For my direct reports, I shared the full context—technical details, political considerations, and how their work fit in. I also adjusted format: executives got a deck; engineers got a doc and a Slack thread; my team got a 1:1 or team meeting. I learned to read the room—if someone looked confused, I'd pause and ask what would help.

**Result:** We got executive buy-in, product adjusted their plans, and engineering teams migrated smoothly. I received feedback that my updates were "always relevant" to each audience. I learned that tailoring isn't about dumbing down—it's about matching content, depth, and format to what each audience needs to act.
