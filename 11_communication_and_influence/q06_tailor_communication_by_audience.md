# How do you tailor your communication style depending on the audience?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you're not a one-size-fits-all communicator—you adjust depth, tone, and focus based on who you're talking to. They're assessing your emotional intelligence and ability to meet people where they are.

## Key Points to Cover

- How you adapt for executives vs. peers vs. direct reports
- Adjusting technical depth and jargon
- Matching format to audience (slides vs. docs vs. verbal)
- Reading the room and adjusting in real time

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give a concrete contrast: "With executives I lead with outcomes; with engineers I go into architecture"
- Avoid sounding like you're "dumbing down" for some audiences—frame it as meeting their needs
