# How do you communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can bridge the gap between engineering and business—explaining complex ideas in accessible terms without condescending. They're assessing your ability to focus on outcomes, risks, and trade-offs rather than implementation details.

## Key Points to Cover

- Using analogies, visuals, or simple language instead of jargon
- Leading with "why" and impact rather than "how"
- Checking for understanding and inviting questions
- Adapting based on the audience (executives vs. product vs. support)

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give a concrete example: "When explaining our migration to microservices, I compared it to..." 
- Avoid saying "I dumb it down"—instead, "I translate to business impact and outcomes"
