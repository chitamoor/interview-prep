# How do you ensure alignment and clear communication across cross-functional teams?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you proactively prevent silos and misalignment—through rituals, documentation, and relationship-building. They're assessing your ability to coordinate engineering with product, design, and other functions without creating bottlenecks or confusion.

## Key Points to Cover

- Regular sync mechanisms: standups, planning, retrospectives, shared docs
- Shared goals and success criteria (OKRs, definitions of done)
- Clear ownership and handoff points
- How you handle conflicts or misalignment when they arise
