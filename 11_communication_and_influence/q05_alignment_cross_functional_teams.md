# How do you ensure alignment and clear communication across cross-functional teams?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you proactively prevent silos and misalignment—through rituals, documentation, and relationship-building. They're assessing your ability to coordinate engineering with product, design, and other functions without creating bottlenecks or confusion.

## Key Points to Cover

- Regular sync mechanisms: standups, planning, retrospectives, shared docs
- Shared goals and success criteria (OKRs, definitions of done)
- Clear ownership and handoff points
- How you handle conflicts or misalignment when they arise

- Include an example where alignment prevented a problem or resolved a conflict

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a marketplace company, we had separate engineering, product, design, and operations teams. We'd had several incidents where features shipped without proper ops readiness, or product committed to timelines without engineering input. Silos were causing rework and missed expectations.

**Task:** I was responsible for improving alignment and communication across these teams so we could deliver more predictably.

**Action:** I introduced several mechanisms. First, a shared weekly planning sync: product, design, eng, and ops leads met for 60 minutes to review the backlog, dependencies, and blockers. We used a shared doc for the agenda and outcomes. Second, we adopted a definition of done that included ops sign-off—no feature could "ship" without runbooks and monitoring. Third, we created a #launch-coordination channel for real-time updates during releases. Fourth, we ran a quarterly "alignment retro" where we reviewed what had gone wrong and adjusted our rituals. When we had a conflict—product wanted to ship a feature that ops said wasn't ready—I facilitated a 30-minute sync. We surfaced the disagreement, agreed on criteria for "ready," and pushed the date by one week. We documented the decision so it wouldn't recur.

**Result:** We reduced cross-functional misalignment incidents by about 70% over two quarters. Our on-time delivery improved, and the teams reported higher trust. I learned that alignment requires explicit rituals, shared artifacts, and a process for resolving conflicts when they arise—it doesn't happen by accident.
