# Describe a time when miscommunication caused a problem. How did you resolve it and prevent it from recurring?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you take ownership of communication failures and learn from them. They're assessing your self-awareness, problem-solving, and ability to implement process improvements—not just blame others.

## Key Points to Cover

- What went wrong and whose expectations were misaligned
- How you identified and fixed the immediate issue
- What you did to prevent recurrence (process, documentation, rituals)
- What you learned about your own communication habits
