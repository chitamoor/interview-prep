# Describe a time when you had to sell a technical idea to skeptical stakeholders.

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see your persuasion skills—how you overcome resistance, address concerns, and build buy-in for technical initiatives. They're assessing your ability to listen, adapt your pitch, and use evidence and empathy to win support.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding the source of skepticism (risk, cost, unfamiliarity, competing priorities)
- Adapting your message to address their concerns
- Using proof points: pilots, benchmarks, case studies
- Building trust through transparency and follow-through

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Choose an example where you succeeded—or where you learned something valuable from the pushback
- Emphasize that you listened first and tailored your approach based on their objections

## Example Response

**Situation:** I proposed migrating our main application to a new cloud region to reduce latency for our APAC customers. The product and finance teams were skeptical—they saw cost, risk, and disruption with no guaranteed revenue lift. I was the engineering manager making the case.

**Task:** I had to sell a technical initiative to stakeholders who didn't see the value and were worried about the downside.

**Action:** I started by understanding their concerns. In 1:1s, I heard: "What if something breaks?" "How much will this cost?" "Can't we just optimize the current setup?" I tailored my pitch to each. For product, I framed it as customer experience—we had support tickets and NPS data showing APAC users experienced 2–3x higher latency. For finance, I built a cost model: the migration would cost X one-time and Y ongoing, but we'd avoid Z in potential churn (I used conservative estimates from our data team). For risk, I proposed a phased rollout: read replicas first, then gradual traffic shift, with rollback plans. I also ran a two-week pilot in a non-critical service to prove we could do it safely. I brought proof: latency metrics from the pilot, a case study from a similar company. When they pushed back on timeline, I offered a compromise: we could do it in 12 weeks instead of 8 if we deferred a lower-priority project.

**Result:** We got approval. We executed the migration with zero incidents. APAC latency dropped by 60%, and we saw a 4% improvement in APAC retention over the next quarter. I learned that selling technical ideas requires listening first, addressing each stakeholder's concerns specifically, and backing claims with evidence—and that pilots and phased approaches reduce perceived risk.
