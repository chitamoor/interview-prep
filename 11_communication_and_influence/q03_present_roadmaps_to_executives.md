# How do you present engineering roadmaps and progress to executive leadership?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can speak at the right level for executives—focusing on strategy, risk, and outcomes rather than tactical details. They're assessing your ability to build credibility, handle tough questions, and align engineering work with business priorities.

## Key Points to Cover

- Leading with outcomes and business impact, not implementation details
- Using clear visuals and a concise narrative
- Anticipating and preparing for tough questions
- Being honest about risks, delays, and trade-offs

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Mention the "elevator pitch" principle: executives want the headline first, details on request
- Include how you handle pushback or skepticism—e.g., "I bring data to back up our estimates"

## Example Response

**Situation:** I was asked to present our engineering roadmap to the C-suite at a quarterly business review. The audience included the CEO, CFO, and CRO—none technical. They cared about strategy, risk, and ROI. I had 15 minutes and needed to cover six months of work across four teams.

**Task:** I had to communicate our roadmap at the right level—outcomes and impact, not implementation details—and handle tough questions.

**Action:** I structured the deck around three sections: where we are, where we're going, and what we need. I led each section with a one-sentence headline. For "where we're going," I used a simple timeline with milestones and business outcomes—e.g., "Q2: New checkout flow—expected 5% conversion lift." I avoided jargon; when I had to mention technical concepts, I paired them with business impact. I anticipated questions: "Why will this take 6 months?" I had a one-pager with a high-level breakdown and dependencies. "What if we cut scope?" I had a prioritized list of what we could defer. When the CFO asked about cost overruns on a past project, I acknowledged it, explained what we'd learned, and showed how we'd changed our estimation process. I kept the deck to 10 slides; the rest were appendix for deep dives.

**Result:** We got alignment on the roadmap and approval for two additional hires. The CEO said it was one of the clearest engineering updates he'd seen. I learned that executives want the headline first, evidence on demand, and honesty about risks—and that preparing for pushback builds credibility.
