# How do you present engineering roadmaps and progress to executive leadership?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can speak at the right level for executives—focusing on strategy, risk, and outcomes rather than tactical details. They're assessing your ability to build credibility, handle tough questions, and align engineering work with business priorities.

## Key Points to Cover

- Leading with outcomes and business impact, not implementation details
- Using clear visuals and a concise narrative
- Anticipating and preparing for tough questions
- Being honest about risks, delays, and trade-offs
