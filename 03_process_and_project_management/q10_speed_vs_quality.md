# How do you balance speed of delivery with engineering quality?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you make intentional trade-offs rather than defaulting to "move fast" or "do it right." They're looking for context-aware judgment—knowing when to invest in quality and when to ship quickly with a plan to iterate.

## Key Points to Cover

- Assessing context (criticality, longevity, team capacity)
- Defining "good enough" for different scenarios
- Building in quality practices that don't slow you down
- Being explicit about trade-offs with stakeholders

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give examples of when you prioritized speed vs. quality and your reasoning
- Show you avoid false dichotomies—often you can have both with the right practices
