# What tools have you used for project tracking, and how do you ensure transparency in project status?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you use tools effectively to create visibility—for the team, stakeholders, and leadership. They're looking for consistency, clarity, and practices that make status easy to understand without constant meetings.

## Key Points to Cover

- Tools you've used (Jira, Linear, Asana, etc.) and how you configured them
- What you track (tasks, milestones, risks, blockers)
- How you communicate status (dashboards, reports, demos)
- Balancing detail with simplicity so people actually use it

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Focus on outcomes (visibility, reduced status meetings) not just tool names
- Mention how you've adapted tools to fit team workflow
