# How do you run post-mortems and incident reviews? How do you ensure follow-through on action items?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you treat incidents as learning opportunities. They're looking for a blameless process, root cause analysis, and a system to ensure action items actually get done—not just documented and forgotten.

## Key Points to Cover

- Blameless culture and psychological safety
- Structured format (timeline, root cause, contributing factors)
- Action items with owners and deadlines
- Tracking and closing out follow-up items
