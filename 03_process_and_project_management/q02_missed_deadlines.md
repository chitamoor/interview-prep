## Example Response

**Situation:** At a health-tech company, my team was building an integration with a major EHR vendor. We'd committed to a launch date to align with their release cycle—missing it would push us out 6 months. At the 60% mark, we discovered their API had undocumented rate limits that would require a significant architecture change. We were going to miss the deadline.

**Task:** I needed to communicate early, reset expectations, and replan without damaging the relationship with the vendor or our leadership.

**Action:** As soon as we confirmed the delay, I scheduled a call with the vendor and our leadership—within 24 hours. I presented the situation, root cause, and a revised timeline. I didn't blame the vendor; I framed it as a discovery we should have caught earlier. I proposed a phased approach: we'd deliver a limited scope by the original date (enough to preserve the relationship) and full scope 6 weeks later. I also ran a blameless post-mortem with the team to identify how we could have caught this earlier—we added API validation to our integration checklist. I sent weekly status updates to stakeholders until we shipped.

**Result:** We delivered the limited scope on the original date and full scope 5 weeks later. The vendor appreciated our transparency. Leadership trusted us more because we'd communicated proactively. I learned that bad news early is better than bad news late—and that having a contingency plan (phased delivery) makes the conversation easier.
