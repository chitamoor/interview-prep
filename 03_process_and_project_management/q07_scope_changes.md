# How do you handle scope changes or requirement shifts mid-sprint or mid-project?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can adapt to change without chaos. They're looking for a process to evaluate new requests, communicate impact, and re-prioritize—while protecting the team from constant context-switching.

## Key Points to Cover

- A process for evaluating and triaging change requests
- Communicating impact (timeline, scope, trade-offs) to stakeholders
- Deciding what gets deprioritized when something new comes in
- Balancing flexibility with predictability

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a payments company, we were three weeks into a 6-week sprint building a new refund flow. The VP of Product came to me with an "urgent" request: add support for partial refunds and refund-to-store-credit. That would double our scope mid-sprint. The team had already committed to the current scope, and adding this would mean cutting corners or slipping.

**Task:** I needed to evaluate the request, communicate impact, and either negotiate or push back—without damaging the relationship or burning out the team.

**Action:** I asked the VP what was driving the urgency. It turned out a key customer had requested it for a deal closing in 4 weeks. I ran a quick impact assessment: partial refunds would add ~1.5 weeks, store credit another week. I presented options: (A) slip the sprint by 2 weeks and deliver everything, (B) deliver partial refunds this sprint and store credit in the next, or (C) deliver the original scope and add both in a follow-up sprint. I recommended B—it would satisfy the customer's immediate need and we could commit to store credit with a date. The VP agreed. I communicated the change to the team, deprioritized one lower-value item from the sprint, and updated stakeholders.

**Result:** We delivered partial refunds on time, which helped close the deal. Store credit landed in the next sprint. The team didn't feel like we'd caved to chaos—we'd made a deliberate trade-off. I learned that scope changes are inevitable; the key is having a process to evaluate them and being willing to negotiate rather than just say yes or no.
