# What development methodologies have you used? Which one do you prefer and why?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to understand your experience with different ways of working (Scrum, Kanban, etc.) and whether you can adapt to their context. They're looking for thoughtful preferences—not dogma—and awareness of when different approaches fit best.

## Key Points to Cover

- Experience with specific methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, hybrid)
- Pros and cons you've observed in practice
- How you adapt methodology to team and context
- What you'd recommend for different situations

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Avoid saying one methodology is "best"—show you tailor to context
- Include an example of when you changed or hybridized a process and why
