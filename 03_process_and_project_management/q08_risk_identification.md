# What's your approach to risk identification and mitigation in projects?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you think ahead about what could go wrong. They're looking for proactive identification of technical, schedule, and dependency risks—and concrete mitigation or contingency plans.

## Key Points to Cover

- When and how you identify risks (kickoff, planning, ongoing)
- Categorizing and prioritizing risks (likelihood × impact)
- Mitigation vs. contingency strategies
- Making risks visible to stakeholders
