# How do you handle time zone differences in a global team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can lead across geographies without burning out team members or creating "second-class" time zones. They're assessing your awareness of equity, meeting design, handoff practices, and how you balance real-time collaboration with async work.

## Key Points to Cover

- Meeting rotation: alternating meeting times so no single region is always inconvenienced
- Overlap windows: identifying and protecting core hours for cross-timezone collaboration
- Handoffs and documentation: ensuring work continues across time zones without bottlenecks
- Awareness: being mindful of who bears the burden of odd-hour meetings

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Show you rotate meeting times or use async alternatives rather than always favoring one time zone
- Mention "follow the sun" or similar patterns for support or handoffs when relevant
- Acknowledge trade-offs: sometimes someone has to take an odd-hour call, but it shouldn't always be the same people
