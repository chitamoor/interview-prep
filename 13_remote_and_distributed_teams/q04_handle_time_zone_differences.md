# How do you handle time zone differences in a global team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can lead across geographies without burning out team members or creating "second-class" time zones. They're assessing your awareness of equity, meeting design, handoff practices, and how you balance real-time collaboration with async work.

## Key Points to Cover

- Meeting rotation: alternating meeting times so no single region is always inconvenienced
- Overlap windows: identifying and protecting core hours for cross-timezone collaboration
- Handoffs and documentation: ensuring work continues across time zones without bottlenecks
- Awareness: being mindful of who bears the burden of odd-hour meetings

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Show you rotate meeting times or use async alternatives rather than always favoring one time zone
- Mention "follow the sun" or similar patterns for support or handoffs when relevant
- Acknowledge trade-offs: sometimes someone has to take an odd-hour call, but it shouldn't always be the same people

## Example Response

**Situation:** I led a platform team with engineers in San Francisco (6), London (4), and Singapore (3). Our previous manager had held all-team meetings at 9am PT—convenient for SF, brutal for Singapore (midnight) and London (5pm). Singapore engineers had complained about burnout and feeling like "second-class" team members.

**Task:** I needed to redesign our collaboration to be fair across time zones while still enabling real-time work when it mattered. I couldn't eliminate all odd-hour meetings, but I could distribute the burden.

**Action:** I mapped overlap windows: SF–London had ~3 hours, London–Singapore had ~2 hours, SF–Singapore had almost none. I established a rotating meeting schedule: one week we'd meet at 9am PT (SF-friendly), the next at 4pm London (London–Singapore overlap), the next at 9am Singapore (Singapore-friendly). I documented this in our team charter so everyone understood the principle. For decisions that didn't need sync, we used async RFCs with a 48-hour comment window so all time zones could participate. I also set up "follow the sun" for incident response—handoffs at overlap times so no one region carried the pager 24/7. I tracked who was taking late/early calls and made sure it rotated; I took some myself to model that it wasn't just "other" people's problem.

**Result:** Singapore attrition stopped, and our "fairness of meeting times" pulse score went from 2.4 to 4.0. We had one incident where we needed a 2am PT call—I joined it and made sure we rotated who led the next emergency sync. I learned that time zone equity requires explicit design and rotation; otherwise, the "default" location always wins.
