# What tools and practices do you use for asynchronous collaboration?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can lead effectively without relying on real-time presence. They're assessing your familiarity with async workflows, documentation habits, and tooling—and whether you design processes that respect different time zones and work styles.

## Key Points to Cover

- Tools: documentation (Notion, Confluence), project tracking (Jira, Linear), communication (Slack, email), design (Figma, Miro)
- Practices: written decision records, async standups, clear handoff protocols
- When to use async vs. sync: guidelines for when a meeting is necessary
- Reducing meeting load: defaulting to async and reserving meetings for high-value discussions

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Name specific tools and explain *why* you chose them for certain use cases
- Emphasize "default to async" as a principle—meetings by exception, not default
- Include how you onboard new team members to async norms and documentation
