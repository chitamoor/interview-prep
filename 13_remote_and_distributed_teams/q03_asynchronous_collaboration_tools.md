# What tools and practices do you use for asynchronous collaboration?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can lead effectively without relying on real-time presence. They're assessing your familiarity with async workflows, documentation habits, and tooling—and whether you design processes that respect different time zones and work styles.

## Key Points to Cover

- Tools: documentation (Notion, Confluence), project tracking (Jira, Linear), communication (Slack, email), design (Figma, Miro)
- Practices: written decision records, async standups, clear handoff protocols
- When to use async vs. sync: guidelines for when a meeting is necessary
- Reducing meeting load: defaulting to async and reserving meetings for high-value discussions

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Name specific tools and explain *why* you chose them for certain use cases
- Emphasize "default to async" as a principle—meetings by exception, not default
- Include how you onboard new team members to async norms and documentation

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a 150-person startup, we had engineers in SF, NYC, and Berlin. Our default was "hop on a call"—we had 40+ hours of meetings per engineer per week, and people were exhausted. Decisions were made in meetings, so if you missed one, you were out of the loop. We needed to shift to async-first.

**Task:** I led the effort to establish async collaboration practices. My goal was to cut meeting load by half while improving decision quality and inclusion.

**Action:** I introduced an "async by default" policy. We moved standups to a shared Notion doc—each person posted by 10am local with: done, in progress, blockers. We used Linear for project tracking and required written specs for any feature over a certain size. For decisions, we adopted RFCs: propose in a doc, comment for 48 hours, then decide. I created clear guidelines: use Slack for quick questions (expect 4-hour response), use docs for anything that needed thought or would be referenced later. I also defined when a meeting was required: conflict resolution, complex trade-off discussions, or relationship-building. For onboarding, I built a "how we work" doc that explained our tools, response expectations, and decision process—new hires got it on day one and we reviewed it in their first 1:1.

**Result:** We reduced average meeting hours from 42 to 22 per week. Our "decisions are well-documented" score went from 2.5 to 4.1. Berlin engineers reported feeling more included because they could contribute to decisions on their schedule. I learned that async works when you have clear norms, the right tools, and explicit rules for when to break the async default.
