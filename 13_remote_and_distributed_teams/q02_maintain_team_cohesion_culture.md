# How do you maintain team cohesion and culture in a distributed environment?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you proactively build connection and shared identity when people aren't colocated. They're assessing your understanding of what creates cohesion—trust, shared norms, social bonds—and whether you have intentional practices to foster it remotely.

## Key Points to Cover

- Rituals and norms: regular team syncs, async updates, shared documentation
- Social connection: virtual coffee chats, team-building activities, informal channels
- Shared purpose: reinforcing goals, celebrating wins, and creating visibility across locations
- Inclusivity: ensuring remote members feel equally valued and heard

- Mention how you measure or sense cohesion (e.g., engagement, retention, survey feedback)
