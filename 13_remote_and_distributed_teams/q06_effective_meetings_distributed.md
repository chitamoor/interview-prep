# How do you run effective meetings with distributed teams?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you treat distributed meetings as a distinct skill, not just "regular meetings on Zoom." Poorly run remote meetings waste time, exclude people, and erode engagement—they're looking for someone who has learned what works.

## Key Points to Cover

- Clear agendas and pre-reads so people can contribute without being put on the spot
- Facilitation that explicitly includes remote participants (calling on people, chat, polls)
- Appropriate use of video, breakout rooms, and collaborative tools
- Starting and ending on time, and being selective about what needs a meeting
- How you handle technical issues and ensure everyone can participate

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Mention specific facilitation techniques (e.g., "round robin," "raise hand," "type in chat first")
- Show that you question whether a meeting is needed—async alternatives when possible
- Demonstrate awareness that remote participants often feel less included and how you counteract that
