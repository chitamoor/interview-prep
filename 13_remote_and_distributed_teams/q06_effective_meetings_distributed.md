# How do you run effective meetings with distributed teams?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you treat distributed meetings as a distinct skill, not just "regular meetings on Zoom." Poorly run remote meetings waste time, exclude people, and erode engagement—they're looking for someone who has learned what works.

## Key Points to Cover

- Clear agendas and pre-reads so people can contribute without being put on the spot
- Facilitation that explicitly includes remote participants (calling on people, chat, polls)
- Appropriate use of video, breakout rooms, and collaborative tools
- Starting and ending on time, and being selective about what needs a meeting
- How you handle technical issues and ensure everyone can participate

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Mention specific facilitation techniques (e.g., "round robin," "raise hand," "type in chat first")
- Show that you question whether a meeting is needed—async alternatives when possible
- Demonstrate awareness that remote participants often feel less included and how you counteract that

## Example Response

**Situation:** Our team had shifted to hybrid—some in the office, some remote. I noticed remote participants were often silent in meetings, and decisions were being made in side conversations that remote folks missed. We had 25 people across 8 locations, and our weekly sync was becoming a waste of time: no agenda, people talked over each other, and we often ran over by 20 minutes.

**Task:** I took ownership of redesigning our meetings. I wanted to make them inclusive, efficient, and worth the synchronous time.

**Action:** I implemented several practices. Every meeting now required an agenda in the invite 24 hours ahead, with clear outcomes (e.g., "Decide: approach for Q3 migration"). I added a "pre-read" section for anything that needed context. I started using facilitation techniques: "Let's hear from everyone—I'll go round robin" so remote folks weren't drowned out by the loudest voices. For brainstorming, I had people type ideas in the chat or a shared doc first before we discussed—this gave introverts and non-native speakers a chance to contribute. I enforced start and end times rigidly and cut the default from 60 to 45 minutes. I also created a "remote inclusion" checklist: camera on when possible, no side conversations in the room, and I'd explicitly ask "Anyone on video we haven't heard from?" before closing. For topics that didn't need real-time discussion, I moved them to async docs.

**Result:** Our "meetings are productive" score went from 2.8 to 4.2. We reduced meeting time by 25% while improving decision quality. Remote participants said they felt more included. I learned that distributed meetings are a skill—agenda, facilitation, and explicit inclusion practices make the difference between a waste of time and a valuable sync.
