# How do you build relationships and trust with team members you rarely see in person?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you invest in relationships even when it's not convenient. Trust is harder to build remotely—they're assessing whether you have intentional practices for connection and whether you understand that rapport matters for collaboration and retention.

## Key Points to Cover

- Dedicated 1:1 time for non-work conversation and personal connection
- Being present and attentive in video calls (camera on, minimal multitasking)
- Showing interest in people as individuals—remembering details, celebrating milestones
- Creating opportunities for informal interaction (virtual coffee, team socials)
- Consistency and follow-through—trust builds over time through reliability

## Tips

- Give a specific example of building trust with someone you've never met in person
- Show that you don't treat 1:1s as purely transactional—relationship-building is part of the job
- Mention small gestures that matter: remembering a birthday, asking about a hobby, following up on something they shared
