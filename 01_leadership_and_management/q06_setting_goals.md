## Example Response

**Situation:** At a fintech startup, I led a team of 12 engineers. The company had just adopted OKRs but teams were inconsistent—some wrote vague goals, others treated them as task lists. We had no visibility into progress, and quarterly reviews felt like theater. I needed to make the system work for us.

**Task:** My responsibility was to establish a goal-setting and tracking process that aligned with company strategy, gave the team clarity, and enabled accountability without bureaucracy.

**Action:** I introduced a lightweight OKR process: we set 3–5 objectives per quarter with 2–3 key results each, and I ensured every KR was measurable and time-bound. I ran a kickoff where the team co-created the OKRs with me—so they had ownership, not just compliance. I set up a weekly 15-minute check-in where we reviewed progress and blockers, and I used a simple shared doc so stakeholders could see status without asking. When mid-quarter we had to pivot due to a regulatory change, I ran a quick reprioritization session, updated the OKRs with leadership's approval, and communicated the change transparently. I also made it clear what we were deprioritizing and why.

**Result:** By the end of the quarter, we hit 4 of 5 key results. The team reported feeling more aligned and less adrift. Leadership appreciated the visibility. I learned that goals work best when the team owns them and when the process is flexible enough to adapt when reality changes.
