# How do you prioritize tasks and projects for your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to understand your decision-making framework when resources are limited. They're looking for evidence that you can balance business impact, urgency, dependencies, and team capacity—and that you can communicate priorities clearly so the team stays aligned.

## Key Points to Cover

- A clear framework or criteria (e.g., impact vs. effort, business value, urgency)
- How you involve stakeholders and the team in prioritization
- How you handle competing demands and say no when needed
- How you communicate and adjust priorities when things change

## Tips

- Reference a specific framework (e.g., RICE, MoSCoW, impact/effort matrix) if you use one
- Include an example where you had to deprioritize something important to protect higher-impact work
