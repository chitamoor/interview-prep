## Example Response

**Situation:** At a Series B startup, I inherited a team that included an engineer who had been a strong performer historically but had slipped over six months—missed deadlines, incomplete code reviews, and disengagement in standups. The previous manager had avoided the conversation. By the time I took over, the rest of the team was frustrated and picking up the slack.

**Task:** I needed to diagnose the root cause, set clear expectations, and either help the person improve or make a fair decision about their fit—without damaging team trust or creating a culture of fear.

**Action:** I started with a private 1:1 to understand what was going on. I learned they were struggling with a difficult personal situation and felt overwhelmed. I set a 60-day improvement plan with specific, measurable goals: complete code reviews within 24 hours, deliver two sprint commitments on time, and attend all standups. I paired them with a mentor for support and reduced their scope temporarily so they could build momentum. I documented everything and had weekly check-ins. After 45 days, there was improvement but not enough to meet the bar. I escalated to HR, and we had a candid conversation about fit. The engineer chose to leave on good terms.

**Result:** The team appreciated that I addressed the situation fairly and transparently. I improved our performance documentation process so future conversations would be easier. Retention for the rest of the team stayed strong. I learned that delaying difficult conversations helps no one—addressing underperformance early, with empathy and clarity, is the right thing to do.
