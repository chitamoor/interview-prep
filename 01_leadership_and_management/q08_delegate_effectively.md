# How do you delegate effectively while maintaining appropriate oversight?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can scale your impact by empowering others. They're assessing whether you delegate the right things, set clear expectations, and provide support without micromanaging.

## Key Points to Cover

- Matching tasks to people's skills and growth goals
- Setting clear outcomes, constraints, and checkpoints
- Providing resources and support without taking over
- Knowing when to step in vs. let people work through challenges

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a health-tech company, I managed a team of 7. I had a tendency to take on complex technical decisions myself because I was the most senior—but that created a bottleneck and didn't develop the team. We had a critical migration project coming up, and I knew I couldn't own it and everything else. I needed to delegate meaningfully.

**Task:** I had to delegate the migration ownership to a senior engineer while maintaining appropriate oversight—enough to catch risks, not so much that I was micromanaging.

**Action:** I chose an engineer who had strong execution skills but hadn't led a project of this scope. I set clear outcomes: complete the migration with zero data loss, within 8 weeks, with a rollback plan. I defined checkpoints: a design review at week 2, a dry-run at week 5, and a go/no-go at week 7. I made myself available for unblocking but didn't attend every meeting—I asked them to escalate decisions that had cross-team impact. When they hit a blocker with another team, I stepped in to unblock, then stepped back. I also made it explicit that mistakes were acceptable as long as we learned—that reduced their fear of failure.

**Result:** The migration completed on time with no incidents. The engineer grew significantly and later led two more major initiatives. I freed up 15–20 hours per week for strategic work. I learned that delegation works best when you're explicit about outcomes, checkpoints, and escalation—and when you create psychological safety for the delegatee to own it.
