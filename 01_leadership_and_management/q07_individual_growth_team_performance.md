## Key Points to Cover

- Integrating growth into regular work (stretch assignments, ownership)
- Allocating time for learning and skill-building
- Aligning individual goals with team needs
- Knowing when to prioritize team delivery vs. individual development

## Example Response

**Situation:** At a B2B SaaS company, I led a team of 9 engineers. We had aggressive delivery targets, but I also had several engineers who were stagnating—doing the same types of tasks, not growing. I knew that if I only focused on delivery, we'd lose talent and capability over time. But if I over-invested in growth, we'd miss commitments.

**Task:** I needed to integrate individual development into our regular work so that growth and performance reinforced each other rather than competing.

**Action:** I started by mapping each person's growth goals to team needs. One engineer wanted to grow into system design—I gave them ownership of the technical design for our next major feature and paired them with a staff engineer for review. Another wanted to improve their communication—I had them lead our sprint demos and write the architecture doc for a cross-team initiative. I also carved out 10% time for learning: one afternoon every two weeks where people could explore new tech, take a course, or contribute to open source. I made it explicit that this was protected time, not "if you have time." I tracked both delivery metrics and growth milestones in 1:1s.

**Result:** We hit our delivery targets that quarter, and two engineers were promoted. The engineer who led the system design became our go-to for complex architecture decisions. Team satisfaction scores improved. I learned that growth and delivery aren't zero-sum when you align them—stretch assignments that serve the team create win-win outcomes.
