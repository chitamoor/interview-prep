## Example Response

**Situation:** At an e-commerce company, I led a platform team of 8. We had committed to a Q3 launch of a new checkout flow. Mid-sprint, the VP of Product asked us to add three "quick wins" from the marketing team—gift wrapping, loyalty points integration, and a new payment provider—without changing the timeline. The team was already at capacity, and adding scope would mean cutting corners or burning people out.

**Task:** I needed to push back on scope creep while maintaining a strong relationship with the VP and finding a path that didn't leave anyone feeling dismissed.

**Action:** I scheduled a 30-minute call with the VP and came prepared with data: our velocity, our current sprint commitment, and the estimated effort for each request. I framed it as a trade-off conversation, not a refusal. I proposed we prioritize one of the three—loyalty points—because it had the highest impact and could be integrated with minimal rework. For the other two, I suggested we add them to the backlog with clear sequencing for Q4. I also offered to run a lightweight impact analysis so we could make a data-driven decision. The VP initially pushed back, so I asked what would happen if we shipped late or with quality issues—that reframed the conversation around risk.

**Result:** We shipped the checkout flow on time with loyalty points included. The other two features landed in Q4 with proper planning. The VP later thanked me for the clarity and said it helped them manage expectations with marketing. I learned that "no" with data and alternatives is often better received than "yes" that leads to failure.
