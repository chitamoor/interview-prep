## Example Response

**Situation:** At a mid-size SaaS company, I managed an 8-person engineering team. Two senior engineers—one focused on backend, one on frontend—had a long-simmering disagreement over API design that escalated into personal friction. They stopped collaborating, code reviews became tense, and it was affecting the rest of the team. The conflict had been brewing for months before I joined.

**Task:** I needed to address the conflict directly, understand the root cause, and restore productive collaboration without losing either engineer or damaging team morale.

**Action:** I held separate 1:1s with each person first to hear their perspective without the other present. I learned the technical disagreement masked deeper issues: one felt their expertise was being dismissed, the other felt they were being overruled on product-facing decisions. I then facilitated a joint conversation where I set ground rules: we'd focus on the problem, not personalities, and we'd use a structured format. I had them each write down their preferred approach and the trade-offs they saw, then we compared. I also brought in a staff engineer as a neutral technical arbiter. We agreed on a hybrid approach with clear ownership boundaries and a 30-day check-in.

**Result:** Within six weeks, the two were collaborating on a shared component library. I documented the resolution approach for future conflicts. One engineer later told me the private 1:1 made them feel heard for the first time. I learned that conflicts often have emotional roots beneath technical surfaces—addressing both is essential.
