## How to Use This Guide

3. Open individual Q&A files to prepare your answers using the STAR method

## Tips for Answering Behavioral Questions

- **Use the STAR Method**: Structure responses with Situation, Task, Action, and Result
- **Show Your Leadership Philosophy**: Highlight how you empower your team, foster collaboration, and align engineering with business goals
- **Be Data-Driven**: Emphasize how you use metrics and data to make decisions and track success
- **Highlight Impact**: Focus on outcomes and value delivered, not just processes followed
- **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples with real numbers and outcomes
- **Be Authentic**: Draw from genuine experiences — interviewers can tell when stories are fabricated
