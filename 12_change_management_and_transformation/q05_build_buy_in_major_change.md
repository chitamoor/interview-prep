# How do you build buy-in for a major change initiative?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see your approach to getting people on board—through involvement, communication, and addressing concerns. They're assessing your ability to lead change by bringing people along rather than imposing it top-down.

## Key Points to Cover

- Involving key stakeholders early in shaping the change
- Communicating the "why" and benefits repeatedly and through multiple channels
- Creating quick wins to build momentum
- Addressing concerns proactively and adapting based on feedback
