# How do you manage resistance to change within your team or organization?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand resistance as a natural response and that you have strategies to address it—listening, involving people, and addressing fears. They're assessing your empathy and your ability to bring people along rather than forcing change.

## Key Points to Cover

- Listening to understand the root of resistance (fear, loss of control, lack of clarity)
- Involving resistors in the solution where possible
- Communicating the "why" and benefits clearly
- Providing support, training, and time to adapt
