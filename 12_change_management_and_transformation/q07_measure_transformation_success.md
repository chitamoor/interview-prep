# How do you measure whether a transformation initiative is succeeding?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you define success up front and track progress—not just hope that change works. They're assessing your ability to set measurable goals, collect data, and adjust based on results.

## Key Points to Cover

- Defining success criteria before starting (outcomes, not just activity)
- Leading and lagging indicators
- How you collect feedback and data during the transformation
- How you use metrics to adjust the approach
