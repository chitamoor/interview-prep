# What's your approach to phased rollouts vs. big-bang changes?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see your judgment on risk and delivery strategy—when to phase changes for safety vs. when a coordinated cutover makes sense. They're assessing your ability to weigh trade-offs and choose the right approach for the context.

## Key Points to Cover

- When you prefer phased (reduced risk, learn and adapt, rollback easier)
- When big-bang might be necessary (dependencies, data consistency, coordination complexity)
- How you mitigate risk in either approach
- A concrete example of each
