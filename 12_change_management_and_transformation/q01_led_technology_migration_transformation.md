# How have you led a major technology migration or platform transformation?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see your ability to plan and execute large-scale technical change—managing risk, coordinating teams, and delivering value throughout. They're assessing your experience with migrations, refactors, or platform shifts and how you kept the business running during the transition.

## Key Points to Cover

- Clear vision and phased plan (strangler pattern, parallel run, etc.)
- Risk management and rollback strategies
- How you kept stakeholders informed and the business operational
- Team coordination and skill-building for the new technology
