## Example Response

**Situation:** Our company announced a major reorg—our division was merging with another, and our VP was leaving. Rumors were flying: layoffs, role changes, new leadership. My team of 11 engineers was anxious. I didn't have many answers myself—the details were still being worked out at the exec level.

**Task:** I had to keep my team productive and psychologically safe during a period of high uncertainty. I couldn't control the outcome, but I could control how I showed up and what I communicated.

**Action:** I scheduled a team meeting the day after the announcement. I was honest: "Here's what I know, here's what I don't, and here's how we'll get more information." I shared the timeline we'd been given and committed to updating them within 24 hours of learning anything new. I created a simple FAQ doc and updated it as facts emerged. I increased 1:1 frequency to weekly for everyone and made space for people to vent or ask "what if" questions without judgment. I also doubled down on what we could control: we kept our sprint cadence, celebrated small wins, and I made sure our work was visible to incoming leadership so they understood our value. I modeled calm—even when I was uncertain, I didn't spiral in front of the team.

**Result:** We retained all 11 engineers through the transition. Our team's engagement score actually improved slightly, and the new leadership noted our stability during the change. I learned that people can tolerate uncertainty if they trust you're being straight with them and if they have something concrete to focus on.
