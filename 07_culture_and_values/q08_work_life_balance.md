# What role does work-life balance play in how you manage your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you care about sustainability and burnout prevention. They're assessing whether you model healthy boundaries, protect your team from overwork, and create flexibility—without implying that you expect low effort or that high performers can't have balance.

## Key Points to Cover

- Modeling boundaries yourself (e.g., not sending late-night emails, taking vacation)
- Protecting the team from unrealistic deadlines and scope creep
- Offering flexibility (remote, hours, time off) where possible
- Watching for burnout signals and intervening early
