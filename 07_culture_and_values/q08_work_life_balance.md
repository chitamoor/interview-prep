# What role does work-life balance play in how you manage your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you care about sustainability and burnout prevention. They're assessing whether you model healthy boundaries, protect your team from overwork, and create flexibility—without implying that you expect low effort or that high performers can't have balance.

## Key Points to Cover

- Modeling boundaries yourself (e.g., not sending late-night emails, taking vacation)
- Protecting the team from unrealistic deadlines and scope creep
- Offering flexibility (remote, hours, time off) where possible
- Watching for burnout signals and intervening early

- Emphasize that sustainable pace leads to better long-term results

## Example Response

**Situation:** I led a team at a startup in a growth sprint. We had aggressive deadlines, and the norm was "whatever it takes." People were working weekends and late nights. I noticed burnout signals: missed 1:1s, shorter tempers, declining quality. One engineer told me they hadn't taken vacation in 18 months.

**Task:** I needed to protect the team's sustainability while still delivering—and model healthy boundaries myself.

**Action:** I started by modeling: I stopped sending emails after 7pm, I took my vacation, and I said "I'm offline this weekend" in Slack. I pushed back on scope with leadership—"We can do this in 8 weeks with sustainable pace, or we can burn out in 6 and pay for it later." I got a 10-week timeline. I made vacation non-negotiable—everyone had to take at least one week per quarter. I watched for burnout signals and intervened: when someone was consistently online at midnight, I had a 1:1. "What's going on? How can we adjust?" I also celebrated sustainable wins—when we hit a milestone without heroics, I called it out. I made it clear that balance and delivery aren't opposites—sustainable pace delivers better long-term.

**Result:** Voluntary attrition dropped to zero over the next year. We hit our deadlines. I learned that protecting the team from overwork is a manager's job—and that modeling matters more than policy.
