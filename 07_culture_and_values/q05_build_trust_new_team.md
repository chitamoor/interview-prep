# How do you build trust when joining a new team or organization?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have a deliberate approach to earning trust as a new leader. They're assessing whether you listen first, avoid making sweeping changes too quickly, and build credibility through consistency, transparency, and follow-through—rather than assuming trust comes with the title.

## Key Points to Cover

- Listening and learning before making big changes
- Being transparent about your intentions, priorities, and limitations
- Following through on commitments to build credibility
- Respecting existing relationships and not forcing immediate loyalty

## Example Response

**Situation:** I joined a 12-person team as a new manager. They'd had two managers in 18 months and were skeptical. "Another one," I overheard. The team was capable but disengaged—they'd stopped believing leadership would listen.

**Task:** I needed to earn trust before I could lead effectively.

**Action:** I spent my first month listening. I had 1:1s with everyone—not to share my vision, but to understand theirs. I asked: "What's working? What's not? What would you change if you could?" I took notes and didn't promise anything yet. I was transparent: "I'm new. I don't have all the answers. I'm here to learn." I followed through on small things—if someone asked for something, I did it. I didn't make big changes in the first 90 days. I shared what I was learning with the team and asked for their input before proposing changes. When I did make a change, I explained the rationale and tied it to what they'd told me. I also admitted when I was wrong—early on I made a call that didn't work; I owned it in the team meeting.

**Result:** By month four, the team was engaging differently—they started bringing ideas to me. Our eNPS went from 28 to 52 in six months. I learned that trust is earned through listening, follow-through, and humility. The title doesn't grant it.
