# How do you build trust when joining a new team or organization?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you have a deliberate approach to earning trust as a new leader. They're assessing whether you listen first, avoid making sweeping changes too quickly, and build credibility through consistency, transparency, and follow-through—rather than assuming trust comes with the title.

## Key Points to Cover

- Listening and learning before making big changes
- Being transparent about your intentions, priorities, and limitations
- Following through on commitments to build credibility
- Respecting existing relationships and not forcing immediate loyalty
