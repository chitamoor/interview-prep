# How do you handle a situation where team culture diverges from company culture?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can diagnose and address cultural misalignment. They're assessing whether you understand the root causes (e.g., legacy habits, isolated team, conflicting incentives), can bridge the gap without alienating the team, and know when to escalate or involve leadership.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding why the divergence exists (history, incentives, isolation)
- Communicating company culture and values clearly without lecturing
- Finding common ground and gradual alignment, not sudden enforcement
- Escalating when the gap is too large or when values are being violated

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Avoid framing it as "bad team" vs. "good company"—there may be valid reasons for the divergence
- Show that you listen to the team's perspective before pushing alignment
- Emphasize that some divergence can be healthy (e.g., team-specific norms)—focus on values, not rituals

## Example Response

**Situation:** I joined a company that valued "transparency and openness." My team had a different norm—they kept to themselves, didn't share much in all-hands, and preferred async communication. They'd been burned by a previous reorg where information was weaponized. Leadership saw them as "not collaborative."

**Task:** I needed to bridge the gap without alienating the team or forcing them into a mold that didn't fit.

**Action:** I first understood why the divergence existed. I had 1:1s and learned about the reorg—people had been blindsided. The team's caution was rational. I didn't lecture them on "company values." Instead, I found common ground: we all wanted to do good work and avoid surprises. I proposed small steps: we'd share our team's wins in a written update for the org—low risk, high visibility. I also advocated with leadership: "This team communicates differently, but they deliver. Let's focus on outcomes, not style." I gradually introduced more sharing—retrospectives, demos—but let the team own the format. I drew the line at values: when someone withheld critical information from a stakeholder, I addressed it. That wasn't "style"—it was a values violation.

**Result:** The team started contributing to org-wide updates. Leadership's perception shifted. I learned that divergence isn't always bad—understand the "why," find common ground, and focus on values over rituals.
