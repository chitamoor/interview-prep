# How do you handle a situation where team culture diverges from company culture?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you can diagnose and address cultural misalignment. They're assessing whether you understand the root causes (e.g., legacy habits, isolated team, conflicting incentives), can bridge the gap without alienating the team, and know when to escalate or involve leadership.

## Key Points to Cover

- Understanding why the divergence exists (history, incentives, isolation)
- Communicating company culture and values clearly without lecturing
- Finding common ground and gradual alignment, not sudden enforcement
- Escalating when the gap is too large or when values are being violated

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Avoid framing it as "bad team" vs. "good company"—there may be valid reasons for the divergence
- Show that you listen to the team's perspective before pushing alignment
- Emphasize that some divergence can be healthy (e.g., team-specific norms)—focus on values, not rituals
