# How do you ensure psychological safety in your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you understand psychological safety—the belief that one can speak up, ask questions, or admit mistakes without fear of punishment or humiliation. They're assessing whether you actively create conditions for it through your behavior, norms, and response to feedback or failure.

## Key Points to Cover

- Modeling vulnerability (admitting mistakes, asking for help, saying "I don't know")
- Responding constructively when people raise concerns or disagree
- Avoiding blame and focusing on learning from failures
- Creating norms where dissent and questions are welcomed
