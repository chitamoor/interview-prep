# What's your approach to fostering innovation within your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you create conditions for innovation—time, psychological safety, and experimentation—without sacrificing delivery. They're looking for evidence that you encourage new ideas, tolerate failure, and connect innovation to business value.

## Key Points to Cover

- Allocating time and space for experimentation (e.g., hack days, 20% time)
- Creating psychological safety so people propose ideas without fear
- Celebrating learning from failures, not just successes
- Connecting innovation to customer or business outcomes

## Tips

- Describe a specific innovation that came from your team and how you supported it
- Show you balance "innovation" with "execution"—both matter

## Example Response

**Situation:** I led a platform team at a SaaS company. We were good at execution—we hit our sprint commitments—but we rarely tried new approaches. Our tech stack was aging, and we'd been doing "the same thing" for years. Leadership wanted more innovation.

**Task:** I needed to create space for experimentation without sacrificing delivery.

**Action:** I introduced "innovation Fridays"—one Friday per month, the team could work on anything that might improve our platform: new tools, prototypes, experiments. The only rule: share what you learned. I also ran quarterly "idea jams"—30-minute sessions where anyone could pitch an idea, and we'd vote on one to prototype. I made it safe to fail: we celebrated "interesting failures" in retros when we learned something. I tied innovation to outcomes: when a junior engineer proposed a new caching strategy, I gave them time to prototype it. It worked—we reduced latency 20%. I made sure that wins were visible to leadership so innovation had credibility.

**Result:** We shipped three major improvements that originated from innovation time over 18 months. Team satisfaction with "room to experiment" went from 2.8 to 4.1. I learned that innovation needs time, safety, and connection to impact. Execution and innovation can coexist when you carve out space and celebrate learning.
