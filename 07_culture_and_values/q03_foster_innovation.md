# What's your approach to fostering innovation within your team?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you create conditions for innovation—time, psychological safety, and experimentation—without sacrificing delivery. They're looking for evidence that you encourage new ideas, tolerate failure, and connect innovation to business value.

## Key Points to Cover

- Allocating time and space for experimentation (e.g., hack days, 20% time)
- Creating psychological safety so people propose ideas without fear
- Celebrating learning from failures, not just successes
- Connecting innovation to customer or business outcomes
