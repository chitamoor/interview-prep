# How do you encourage diversity of thought and constructive disagreement?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you value different perspectives and don't default to groupthink. They're assessing whether you create space for dissent, reward people who challenge assumptions, and facilitate debates that lead to better decisions—without letting disagreement become destructive.

## Key Points to Cover

- Actively soliciting dissenting views (e.g., "devil's advocate" role, pre-mortems)
- Rewarding and thanking people who speak up with different perspectives
- Facilitating debates with clear norms (attack ideas, not people)
- Ensuring diverse voices are heard, not just the loudest or most senior
