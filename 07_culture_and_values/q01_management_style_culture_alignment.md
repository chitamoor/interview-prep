# What's your management style, and how does it align with our company culture?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to understand how you lead and whether you'll fit their organization. They're looking for self-awareness about your style, flexibility to adapt to different contexts, and evidence that you've researched their culture and can articulate the connection.

## Key Points to Cover

- A clear description of your management style (e.g., servant leader, coaching, situational)
- Specific behaviors that reflect that style
- How you've adapted your style to different teams or companies
- Research-based connection to their stated culture and values
