# What's your management style, and how does it align with our company culture?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to understand how you lead and whether you'll fit their organization. They're looking for self-awareness about your style, flexibility to adapt to different contexts, and evidence that you've researched their culture and can articulate the connection.

## Key Points to Cover

- A clear description of your management style (e.g., servant leader, coaching, situational)
- Specific behaviors that reflect that style
- How you've adapted your style to different teams or companies
- Research-based connection to their stated culture and values

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Research the company's culture and values before the interview—reference them explicitly
- Avoid generic labels; give concrete examples of how your style shows up in behavior
- Show that you can flex—your style may evolve based on team needs and context

## Example Response

**Situation:** I've managed teams at a Fortune 500 (hierarchical, process-heavy) and a Series A startup (chaotic, fast-moving). My natural style is coaching and servant leadership—I prefer to empower and develop people. But I've learned that style must adapt to context.

**Task:** I needed to articulate my style and show how it aligns with different cultures while staying authentic.

**Action:** I describe my style as "situational servant leader": I default to coaching, listening, and removing blockers, but I tighten the reins when clarity or speed is critical. At the Fortune 500, I added more structure—clear RACI matrices, written decision records—because the org needed it. At the startup, I was more hands-on and decisive because the team needed direction. When I interview, I research the company's values. For a "move fast" culture, I emphasize bias for action and delegation. For "customer obsession," I share how I've tied team goals to customer outcomes. I give concrete examples: "I run weekly 1:1s focused on growth, not status—that reflects my belief that development drives performance."

**Result:** I've been told I "fit" well at both companies. I learned that alignment isn't about changing who you are—it's about showing how your values map to theirs and demonstrating flexibility when the context demands it.
