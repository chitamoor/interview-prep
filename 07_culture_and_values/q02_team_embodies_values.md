# How do you ensure that your team embodies the company's values?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you actively reinforce culture, not just assume it happens. They're looking for concrete practices—hiring, recognition, feedback, role modeling—that make values tangible and lived, not just words on a wall.

## Key Points to Cover

- How you translate company values into team behaviors and expectations
- How you hire and onboard for values fit (without excluding diversity)
- How you recognize and reinforce values in day-to-day work
- How you address behavior that conflicts with values

## Tips

- Give specific examples tied to actual company values (e.g., "customer obsession," "bias for action")
- Show that you model the values yourself—you can't expect the team to embody what you don't
- Emphasize that values are for hiring, feedback, and recognition—not just posters

## Example Response

**Situation:** I joined a company where values were on the wall but not in practice. "Customer obsession" was stated, but we had no feedback loops from customers to engineering. "Bias for action" was cited, but decisions stalled in meetings. I led a team of 10 and wanted to make values real.

**Task:** I was responsible for ensuring my team lived the values, not just recited them.

**Action:** I translated each value into behaviors. For "customer obsession": we added a "customer impact" section to every sprint review and invited support to share top pain points. For "bias for action": we adopted a "disagree and commit" norm—decisions in 48 hours max. I hired for values—in interviews, I asked "Tell me about a time you put the customer first when it was inconvenient." I recognized people who embodied values in our team meetings. When someone violated a value—e.g., blamed a customer for a bug—I addressed it in a 1:1 with specific feedback. I also modeled: I shared my own trade-offs and how values guided my decisions.

**Result:** Within a year, our team's engagement score on "we live our values" went from 3.1 to 4.2. I learned that values only matter when they're in hiring, feedback, recognition, and your own behavior—not on posters.
