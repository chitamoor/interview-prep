# How do you ensure that your team embodies the company's values?

## Why This Is Asked

Interviewers want to see that you actively reinforce culture, not just assume it happens. They're looking for concrete practices—hiring, recognition, feedback, role modeling—that make values tangible and lived, not just words on a wall.

## Key Points to Cover

- How you translate company values into team behaviors and expectations
- How you hire and onboard for values fit (without excluding diversity)
- How you recognize and reinforce values in day-to-day work
- How you address behavior that conflicts with values

## STAR Method Answer Template

### Situation
_[Describe the context - what was happening, what team/company, what was at stake]_

### Task
_[What was your specific responsibility or challenge?]_

### Action
_[What specific steps did you take? Be detailed about YOUR actions]_

### Result
_[What was the outcome? Use metrics where possible. What did you learn?]_

## Tips

- Give specific examples tied to actual company values (e.g., "customer obsession," "bias for action")
- Show that you model the values yourself—you can't expect the team to embody what you don't
- Emphasize that values are for hiring, feedback, and recognition—not just posters
